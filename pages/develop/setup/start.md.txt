# Setting Up a Development Environment #

To develop applications using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) you will need a development environment which includes a copy of the EFL itself, a toolchain for compilation, and an integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor. The following pages demonstrate how to set up a development environment on a range of platforms.

EFL can be used in a variety of programming languages, and the instructions for setting up a development environment differ from language to language. The currently documented languages are:

Documentation for developers working in other languages will be added in the future.
