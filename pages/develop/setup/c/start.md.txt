# Setting Up a C Development Environment #

[Installing the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries](https://www.enlightenment.org/docs/distros/start) for C development is a simple task on common platforms.

The following documentation adds to that by describing how to install and run the right tools and prepare for building apps using EFL.
## Compiling EFL Applications ###

With EFL installed, you can start compiling the applications you write using Enlightenment technologies:

```bash
gcc -o your_app your_app.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs eina efl elementary`
```

Where ``your_app`` is the name of the app you want to build and ``your_app.c`` contains the source code of your application.

If the compilation is successful, this will create an executable application called *your_app* in the directory. You can run this app like any other program.

## Troubleshooting ##

If you get errors when you compile the examples in this guide, you may be using an out of date version of EFL. Update your libraries installing from [EFL's git repository](#Installing_from_Git).

If you are having problems compiling and installing EFL, you can come and seek advice on the [any of our IRC channels](https://www.enlightenment.org/contact) or [post a ticket to our Phabricator](https://phab.enlightenment.org).
