# Beta API C# Tutorials #

The following tutorials are designed to build on each other, introducing concepts in a logical manner and working towards full understanding of EFL's capabilities. Most users should approach them in the order in which they are presented; only those with previous EFL experience should skip ahead.

> **NOTE:**
> The tutorials in this section use the latest beta release of the API, as noted in [Developing with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries](/develop/start.md#Current_vs._Beta). Versions of these tutorials written for the current release can be found in the [Legacy section of the website](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/tutorial/start).
