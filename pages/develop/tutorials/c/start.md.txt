# Beta API C Tutorials #

The following tutorials are designed to build on each other, introducing concepts in a logical manner and working towards full understanding of EFL's capabilities. Most users should approach them in the order in which they are presented; only those with previous EFL experience should skip ahead.

Versions of these tutorials written for the Legacy API can be found in the [Legacy section of the website](/develop/legacy/tutorial/start).
