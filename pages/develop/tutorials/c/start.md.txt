# EFL C Tutorials #

If you are just beginning your journey into programming with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), then these tutorials will help you on your way. Designed for those who have prior programming experience but who have not necessarily used EFL before, the tutorials will walk you through writing programs which build on EFL from the basic - a traditional "Hello World" example - through to the more advanced.

If you have not yet done so, visit [Developing with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/start.md) for background on EFL and details on how to set up your development environment.

## Current vs. Beta ##

The documentation on this section of the website is written with a focus on the next-generation release, currently in beta. While this means that the documentation is only partial in places, it will get you started with the very latest revision of EFL and all the new and improved features it brings.

Documentation on the current version of EFL can be found in the [Legacy section](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/). When working through the documentation on the site, keep in mind that if a document is located in ``/develop/legacy`` it is referring to the current release of EFL; if it is located in any other section of ``/develop`` it is referring to the beta release.

Versions of these tutorials written for the current release can be found in the [Legacy section of the website](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/tutorial/start).

## Tutorials ##

The following tutorials are designed to build on each other, introducing concepts in a logical manner and working towards full understanding of EFL's capabilities. Most users should approach them in the order in which they are presented; only those with previous EFL experience should skip ahead.

## IRC Channels ##
