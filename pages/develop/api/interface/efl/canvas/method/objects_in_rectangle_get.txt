===== Description =====

%%Retrieve a list of objects lying over a given rectangular region in a canvas.%%

%%This function will traverse all the layers of the given canvas, from top to bottom, querying for objects with areas overlapping with the given rectangular region inside %%''e''%%. The user can remove from the query objects which are hidden and/or which are set to pass events.%%

%%This function will skip objects parented by smart objects, acting only on the ones at the "top level", with regard to object parenting.%%
