===== C signature =====

===== Values =====

  * **x** - %%The horizontal page relative size%%
  * **y** - %%The vertical page relative size%%
===== Description =====

%%Scroll page size relative to viewport size.%%

%%The scroller is capable of limiting scrolling by the user to "pages". That is to jump by and only show a "whole page" at a time as if the continuous area of the scroller content is split into page sized pieces. This sets the size of a page relative to the viewport of the scroller. 1.0 is "1 viewport" is size (horizontally or vertically). 0.0 turns it off in that axis. This is mutually exclusive with page size (see %%[[:develop:api:mixin:elm:interface_scrollable:property:page_size|Elm.Interface_Scrollable.page_size]]%% for more information). Likewise 0.5 is "half a viewport". Sane usable values are normally between 0.0 and 1.0 including 1.0. If you only want 1 axis to be page "limited", use 0.0 for the other axis.%%
