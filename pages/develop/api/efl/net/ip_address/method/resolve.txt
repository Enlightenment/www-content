===== C signature =====

<code c>
Efl_Future *efl_net_ip_address_resolve(const Eo *obj, const char *address, int family, int flags);
</code>

===== Parameters =====

  * **address** //(in)// - %%The address such as enlightenment.org:http or enlightenment.org (port=0)%%
  * **family** //(in)// - %%Preferred family. AF_UNSPEC or 0 for both, otherwise one of AF_INET or AF_INET6%%
  * **flags** //(in)// - %%Flags to use with getaddrinfo(). If 0, default flags are used (AI_V4MAPPED | AI_ADDRCONFIG, if these exist in your system).%%

===== Description =====

%%Asynchronously resolves host and port names.%%

%%This will resolve the host and port names, returning the results asynchronously in a Future.%%

%%It's based on getaddrinfo() and will receive extra flags to change its behavior.%%

%%Ports can also be named, for example http resolves to 80. Your system database is used (see getaddrinfo()).%%

%%You may try %%[[:develop:api:class:efl:net:ip_address:method:parse|Efl.Net.Ip_Address.parse]]%% if you have numeric values for host and port.%%

//Since 1.19//
