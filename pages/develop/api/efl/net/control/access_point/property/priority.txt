~~Title: Efl.Net.Control.Access_Point.priority~~
===== Values =====

  * **priority** - %%Access point priority in listing%%
===== Description =====

%%The access point priority in the current access point listing.%%

%%This property is dynamic and reflects the index of the access point in the current access points list. As access points may come and go, the value may change at any time and notified with "changed" event.%%

%%If set, then it will reorder priorities, moving all other services at equal or higher priority up. To move as the first (most priority), then use 0. To move as the last priority, use UINT32_MAX or the last known priority + 1.%%

%%@note Only remembered access points may be reordered among themselves. Those that are not remembered will always come last in random order defined by the backend.%%

//Since 1.19//
