~~Title: Efl.Net.Control.Technology.scan~~
===== Description =====

%%Explicitly trigger a scan.%%

%%The scan will happen asynchronously in the background, with the results being delivered by events in the technology, %%[[:develop:api:efl:net:control|Efl.Net.Control]]%% or %%[[:develop:api:efl:net:control:access_point|Efl.Net.Control.Access_Point]]%% associated with the technology. For example, scan on WiFi will add and delete access points.%%

%%It is worth to mention that explicit scans should be avoided. Rare cases are when user requested them, like entering a configuration dialog which demands fresh state. Otherwise prefer to let the system passively do scans in a timely manner.%%
