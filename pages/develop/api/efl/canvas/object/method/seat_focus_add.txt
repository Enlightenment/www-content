===== C signature =====

<code c>
Eina_Bool efl_canvas_object_seat_focus_add(Eo *obj, Efl_Input_Device *seat);
</code>

===== Parameters =====

  * **seat** //(in)// - %%The seat that should be added to the focus list. Use %%''null''%% for the default seat.%%

===== Description =====

%%Add a seat to the focus list.%%

%%Evas supports that an Efl.Canvas.Object may be focused by multiple seats at the same time. This function adds a new seat to the focus list, in other words, after the seat is added to the list this object will now be also focused by this new seat.%%

%%This function generates an @ref EFL_CANVAS_OBJECT_EVENT_FOCUS_DEVICE_IN event.%%

%%@note The old focus APIs ( @ref evas_object_focus_get, @ref evas_object_focus_set, %%[[:develop:api:class:efl:canvas:object:method:key_grab|Efl.Canvas.Object.key_grab]]%%) will still work, however they will only act on the default seat.%%

//Since 1.19//
