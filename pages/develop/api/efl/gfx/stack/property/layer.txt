==== Getter ====

%%Retrieves the layer of its canvas that the given object is part of.%%

%%See also %%[[:develop:api:efl:gfx:stack:property:layer|Efl.Gfx.Stack.layer.set]]%%()%%


{{page>:develop:api-include:efl:gfx:stack:property:layer:getter_description&nouser&nolink&nodate}}

==== Setter ====

%%Sets the layer of its canvas that the given object will be part of.%%

%%If you don't use this function, you'll be dealing with an unique layer of objects, the default one. Additional layers are handy when you don't want a set of objects to interfere with another set with regard to stacking. Two layers are completely disjoint in that matter.%%

%%This is a low-level function, which you'd be using when something should be always on top, for example.%%

<note warning>
%%Be careful, it doesn't make sense to change the layer of smart objects' children. Smart objects have a layer of their own, which should contain all their children objects.%%
</note>
