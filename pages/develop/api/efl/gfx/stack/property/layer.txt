~~Title: Efl.Gfx.Stack.layer~~
===== Description =====




{{page>:develop:api-include:efl:gfx:stack:property:layer:description&nouser&nolink&nodate}}

===== Values =====

  * **l** - %%The number of the layer to place the object on. Must be between #EFL_GFX_STACK_LAYER_MIN and #EFL_GFX_STACK_LAYER_MAX.%%
==== Getter ====

%%Retrieves the layer of its canvas that the given object is part of.%%

%%See also %%[[:develop:api:efl:gfx:stack:property:layer|Efl.Gfx.Stack.layer.set]]%%()%%


{{page>:develop:api-include:efl:gfx:stack:property:layer:getter_description&nouser&nolink&nodate}}

==== Setter ====

%%Sets the layer of its canvas that the given object will be part of.%%

%%If you don't use this function, you'll be dealing with an unique layer of objects (the default one). Additional layers are handy when you don't want a set of objects to interfere with another set with regard to stacking. Two layers are completely disjoint in that matter.%%

%%This is a low-level function, which you'd be using when something should be always on top, for example.%%

<note warning>
%%Don't change the layer of smart objects' children. Smart objects have a layer of their own, which should contain all their child objects.%%
</note>
