~~Title: Efl.Loop.Timer.parent~~
===== Values =====

  * **parent** - %%The new parent%%
===== Description =====

%%The parent of an object.%%

%%Parents keep references to their children so in order to delete objects that have parents you need to set parent to NULL or use efl_del() that does that for you (and also unrefs the object).%%

%%The Eo parent is conceptually user set. That means that a parent should not be changed behind the scenes in a surprising manner.%%

%%For example: if you have a widget that has a box internally, and when you swallow into that widget the object you swallow ends up in the box, the parent should be the widget, and not the box.%%
