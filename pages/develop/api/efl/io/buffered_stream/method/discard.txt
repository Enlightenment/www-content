~~Title: Efl.Io.Buffered_Stream.discard~~
===== Description =====

%%Discards the given number of bytes.%%

%%This has the same effect as reading and discarding the given amount of bytes, without executing the actual copy.%%

%%It's often paired with %%[[:develop:api:efl:io:buffered_stream:property:slice|Efl.Io.Buffered_Stream.slice]]%%. If users read the information from the slice, once they're done that data must be discarded.%%

%%By way of example, some protocols provide messages with a "size" header. In that case %%[[:develop:api:efl:io:buffered_stream:property:slice|Efl.Io.Buffered_Stream.slice]]%% is used to peek into the available memory to see if there is a "size" and if the rest of the slice is the full payload. Here the slice may be handled by a processing function. When the function is complete, that amount of data must be discarded -- by this function.%%
