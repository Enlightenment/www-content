  * **ignore** - %%The event does not change the state of the recognizer.%%
  * **maybe** - %%The event changed the internal state of the recognizer, but it isn't clear yet if it is a  gesture or not. The recognizer needs to filter more events to decide.%%
  * **trigger** - %%The gesture has been triggered%%
  * **finish** - %%The gesture has been finished successfully.%%
  * **cancel** - %%The event made it clear that it is not a gesture. If the gesture recognizer was in Triggered state before, then the gesture is canceled.%%
  * **result_mask** - %%The gesture result mask%%
