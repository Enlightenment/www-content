===== C signature =====

<code c>
void elm_obj_genlist_item_update(Eo *obj);
</code>

===== Description =====

%%Update all the contents of an item.%%

%%This updates an item by calling all the item class functions again to get the contents, texts and states. Use this when the original item data has changed and the changes are desired to be reflected.%%

%%Use elm_genlist_realized_items_update() to update all already realized items.%%

%%This also updates internal genlist item object (edje_object as of now). So when this is called between mouse down and mouse up, mouse up event will be ignored because edje_object is deleted and created again by this API. If you want to avoid this, please use @ref elm_genlist_item_fields_update.%%
