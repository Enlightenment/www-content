===== Description =====



{{page>:develop:user:class:elm:genlist:item:property:select_mode:description&nouser&nolink&nodate}}

==== Getter ====

%%Get the genlist item's select mode.%%

%%It's ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_MAX on failure.%%

{{page>:develop:user:class:elm:genlist:item:property:select_mode:getter_description&nouser&nolink&nodate}}

==== Setter ====

%%Set the genlist item's select mode.%%

%%ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_DEFAULT means that the item will only call their selection func and callback when first becoming selected. Any further clicks will do nothing, unless you set always select mode.%%

%%ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_ALWAYS means that even if selected, every click will make the selected callbacks be called.%%

%%ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_NONE will turn off the ability to select the item entirely and they will neither appear selected nor call selected callback functions.%%

%%ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_DISPLAY_ONLY will apply no-finger-size rule with ELM_OBJECT_SELECT_MODE_NONE. No-finger-size rule makes an item can be smaller than lower limit. Clickable objects should be bigger than human touch point device (your finger) for some touch or small screen devices. So it is enabled, the item can be shrink than predefined finger-size value. And the item will be updated.%%{{page>:develop:user:class:elm:genlist:item:property:select_mode:getter_description&nouser&nolink&nodate}}
