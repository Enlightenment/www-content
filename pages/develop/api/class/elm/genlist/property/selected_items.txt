===== Description =====

%%Get a list of selected items in the genlist.%%

%%It returns a list of the selected items. This list pointer is only valid so long as the selection doesn't change (no items are selected or unselected, or unselected implicitl by deletion). The list contains genlist items pointers. The order of the items in this list is the order which they were selected, i.e. the first item in this list is the first item that was selected, and so on.%%

%%If not in multi-select mode, consider using function %%[[:develop:api:class:elm:genlist:property:selected_item|Elm.Genlist.selected_item.get]]%% instead.%%
