<code c>
void elm_obj_box_recalculate(Eo *obj);
</code>

===== Description =====

%%Force the box to recalculate its children packing.%%

%%If any children was added or removed, box will not calculate the values immediately rather leaving it to the next main loop iteration. While this is great as it would save lots of recalculation, whenever you need to get the position of a just added item you must force recalculate before doing so.%%
