===== Description =====

%%Returns a bitmask with the default mouse buttons currently pressed, set to 1.%%

%%Calling this function will return a 32-bit integer with the appropriate bits set to 1 that correspond to a mouse button being depressed. This limits Evas to a mouse devices with a maximum of 32 buttons, but that is generally in excess of any host system's pointing device abilities.%%

%%A canvas by default begins with no mouse buttons being pressed and only pointer move events can alter that.%%

%%The least significant bit corresponds to the first mouse button (button 1) and the most significant bit corresponds to the last mouse button (button 32).%%

%%If %%''e''%% is not a valid canvas, the return value is undefined.%%
