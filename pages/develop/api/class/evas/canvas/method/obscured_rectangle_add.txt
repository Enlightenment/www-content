===== Description =====

%%Add an "obscured region" to an Evas canvas.%%

%%This is the function by which one tells an Evas canvas that a part of it must not be repainted. The region must be rectangular and its coordinates inside the canvas viewport are passed in the call. After this call, the region specified won't participate in any form in Evas' calculations and actions during its rendering updates, having its displaying content frozen as it was just after this function took place.%%

%%We call it "obscured region" because the most common use case for this rendering (partial) freeze is something else (most probably other canvas) being on top of the specified rectangular region, thus shading it completely from the user's final scene in a display. To avoid unnecessary processing, one should indicate to the obscured canvas not to bother about the non-important area.%%

%%The majority of users won't have to worry about this function, as they'll be using just one canvas in their applications, with nothing inset or on top of it in any form.%%

%%To make this region one that has to be repainted again, call the function @ref evas_obscured_clear.%%

%%This is a very low level function, which most of Evas' users wouldn't care about.%%
</note>

%%This function does not flag the canvas as having its state changed. If you want to re-render it afterwards expecting new contents, you have to add "damage" regions yourself (see @ref evas_damage_rectangle_add).%%
