}
</code>

===== C signature =====

<code c>
void efl_ui_win_prop_focus_skip_set(Eo *obj, Eina_Bool skip);
</code>

===== Values =====

  * **skip** - %%The skip flag state (%%''true''%% if it is to be skipped).%%
===== Description =====

%%Set the window to be skipped by keyboard focus.%%

%%This sets the window to be skipped by normal keyboard input. This means a window manager will be asked to not focus this window as well as omit it from things like the taskbar, pager, "alt-tab" list etc. etc.%%

%%Call this and enable it on a window BEFORE you show it for the first time, otherwise it may have no effect.%%

%%Use this for windows that have only output information or might only be interacted with by the mouse or fingers, and never for typing input. Be careful that this may have side-effects like making the window non-accessible in some cases unless the window is specially handled. Use this with care.%%
