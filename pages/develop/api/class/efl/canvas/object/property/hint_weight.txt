===== Description =====

%%Hints for an object's weight.%%

%%This is a hint on how a container object should resize a given child within its area. Containers may adhere to the simpler logic of just expanding the child object's dimensions to fit its own (see the %%[[:develop:api:var:efl:gfx:size:hint:expand|Efl.Gfx.Size.Hint.Expand]]%% helper weight macro) or the complete one of taking each child's weight hint as real weights to how much of its size to allocate for them in each axis. A container is supposed to, after normalizing the weights of its children (with weight  hints), distribut the space it has to layout them by those factors -- most weighted children get larger in this process than the least ones.%%

%%Accepted values are zero or positive values. Some containers might use this hint as a boolean, but some others might consider it as a proportion, see documentation of each container.%%

%%Default weight hint values are 0.0, for both axis.%%
