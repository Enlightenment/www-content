===== Values =====

  * **path** - %%Path to cookie jar%%
===== Description =====

%%This property sets the filename where to read and write cookies.%%

%%By setting a file to load and persist cookies to, the internal cookie system will be activated, automatically handling HTTP headers such as 'Set-cookie:' and sending the appropriate cookies for a server.%%

%%If a new, empty session is to be used, start with an empty or non-existent file such as created with mkstemp() or tmpfile(). An alternative is to use an empty string ("") to keep it in memory.%%

%%If it is desired to start from a pre-existent cookie jar but do not want to modify that, first copy that file and then pass the new, temporary file.%%

%%Likewise, if it's desired to fill some cookies to the system, create a cookie jar and pass its path to this property.%%

%%@note that whenever this property is set, even if to the same value, it will flush all cookies to the previously set file, then erase all known cookies, then use the new file (if any).%%
