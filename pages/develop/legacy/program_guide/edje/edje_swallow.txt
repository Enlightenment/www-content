===== Edje Swallow =====

The parent of all layout widgets is Edje. Edje as explained in the
[[/program_guide/edje/edje_parts_and_blocks|Edje Parts and Blocks]] using text
description. One of its main features is the possibility to create "Swallows"
objects. When this kind of object is added in an Evas, it contains any other
''Evas_Object''. To create a swallow part, create first the EDC file:

<code c>
collections
{
   group
   {
      name: "container";
      parts
      {
         part
         {
            name: "part.swallow"
            type: SWALLOW;
            description
            {
               state: "default" 0.0;
               rel1.offset: 31 31;
               rel2.offset: -32 -32;
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
</code>

This EDC describes a group named "container", with one part inside of type
SWALLOW and with the name ''part.swallow''. This part is centered inside the
parent (it is the default behavior) but there are 32 pixels free all around
this part. Use ''edje_cc'' to compile the EDC file into a binary EDJ file:

<code c>
edje_cc -o container.edj container.edc
</code>

Create an Edje object and load this file:

<code c>
edje = edje_object_add(evas_object_evas_get(parent));
edje_object_file_set(edje, "container.edj", "container");
</code>

<note>
''edje_object_add'' as opposed as all elementary object, does not take an
''Evas_Object'' as a parent. Give it the Evas on which the object is added. As
the parent is already added on an Evas by elementary, retrieve a reference on
it by using the ''evas_object_evas_get'' API.
</note>

''edje_object_file_set'' is used to set the Edje file from which the object is
loaded. The object itself is the name of the group as defined in the EDC file,
in this case it is "container".

Use the API ''edje_object_swallow'' to swallow any kind of ''Evas_Object''
inside.

<code c>
ic = elm_icon_add(parent);
elm_image_file_set(ic, "c1.png", NULL);
edje_object_part_swallow(edje, "part.swallow", ic);
</code>

<note>
The ''elm_image_file_set()'' function parameters are linked to Edje. The
second argument in this example is a PNG file; however, it can also be an Edje
file. In that case, the third argument must be the Edje group to load, exactly
as previously shown with the ''edje_object_file_set()'' function.
</note>

Create complex layout for your application with Edje. It is may not be the
most easy way, but it is the most powerful. This Edje layout is used all
around elementary and is the basis of the layout widget.
