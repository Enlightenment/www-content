The photo widget is used to display a photo (such as a contact image). If no
photo is set on it, it displays a person icon to show that it is a photo
placeholder.

==== Adding a Photo ====

This is how to create a photo object.

<code c>
Evas_Object *photo, *parephotoslider = elm_photo_add(parent);
photo = elm_photo_add(parent);
</code>

==== Using Photo Widget ====

A file can be set to the photo widget. Here, ''PHOTO_FILENAME'' is a string
corresponding to the photo file name on the system.

<code c>
elm_photo_file_set(photo, PHOTO_FILENAME);
</code>

We can set the photo as editable, so it can be copied, cut or dragged in
another region of the screen.

<code c>
elm_photo_editable_set(photo, EINA_TRUE);
</code>

It can also be completely visible on the screen.

<code c>
elm_photo_fill_inside_set(photo, EINA_TRUE);
</code>

==== Using Photo Callbacks ====

The following callbacks are registered on the photo widget.

  * ''"clicked"'' - The user has clicked the photo.
  * ''"drag,start"'' - The user starts dragging the inner image out of the photo's frame.
  * ''"drag,end"'' - The user drops the dragged image.

event_info is always NULL.
