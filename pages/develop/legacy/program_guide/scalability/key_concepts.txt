===== Key Concepts =====

When designing the application layout to be scalable, you must pay attention
to the following key concepts:

  * [[#Use_the_relative_position|Use the relative position]]
  * [[#Do_not_fill_the_width_or_height_out_with_a_fixed_size_only|Do not fill the width or height out with a fixed size only]]

=== Understand the character of the relative position and the fixed position ===

In the relative position, the size is determined in proportion to the size
of the referred object. For example, if an orange rectangle occupies 30% of
the green rectangle, and the green rectangle is expanded, the orange rectangle
is expanded accordingly. However, if the scaling value is changed and the
green rectangle is not scaled, the orange rectangle remains unchanged too.

In the fixed position, the size is determined by a value set for the object.
For example, the orange rectangle set to the size of 10. If the green
rectangle is expanded, the orange rectangle does not change. However, if the
scaling value is, for example, doubled, the size of the orange rectangle grows
to 20.

=== Use the relative position ===

If you set the object size as a percentage, the ratio remains fixed regardless
of the changes in the screen size or resolution. If you want the object size
changed in proportion of the window size, use the relative position.

=== Multiply the scaling value, if you use the fixed size ===


If you use the EDC file to set up the layout, you can set the scale in the
''part'' element:

<code c>
parts
{
   part
   {
      name: "box";
      type: RECT;
      scale: 1;
   }
}
</code>

If you set the fixed size in C code, you can use the ''ELM_SCALE_SIZE'' macro:

<code c>
evas_object_size_hint_min_set(object, ELM_SCALE_SIZE(100), ELM_SCALE_SIZE(100));
</code>

=== Do not fill the width or height out with a fixed size only  ===

If you fill the entire height out with a fixed size only and it is scaled, the
end result can be larger than the screen size.

If you set a partial width or height with a fixed size and leave the remaining
area flexible, the layout does not expand outside the screen.
