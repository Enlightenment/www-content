===== Init Ecore_Con =====

Before using the Ecore_Con library, it needs to be initialized.

<code c>
#include <Ecore_Con.h>
// Init ecore_con library.
int ret = ecore_con_init();
// ret is the number of times the library has been initialized
// without shutdown.

</code>

==== Asynchronous DNS lookup  ====

We can do a simple DNS lookup using the following function:

<code c>
EAPI Eina_Bool ecore_con_lookup(const char *     name,
                                Ecore_Con_Dns_Cb done_cb,
                                const void *     data
                               )
</code>

in which:

  * ''name'': the IP address or the server name to translate;
  * ''done_cb'': a callback to notify when the request is done;
  * ''data'': the data to be passed to the callback.

The ''done_cb'' function prototype is :


<code c>
void done_cb(const char *      canonname,
             const char *      ip,
             struct sockaddr * addr,
             int               addrlen,
             void *            data
            )
</code>

where:

  * ''canonname'': the canonical name associated with the address;
  * ''ip'': the resolved IP address;
  * ''addr'': a pointer to the socket address;
  * ''addrlen'': the length of the socket address, in bytes;
  * ''data'': the data passed to the callback.

As an example, we want to know the canonical name of the 140.211.167.135 IP
address. Letâ€™s first declare the ''done_cb'' callback that will be called when
the DNS lookup will finish.

<code c>
static void
done_cb(const char *canonname, const char *ip, struct sockaddr *addr, int addrlen, void *data)
{
   printf("140.211.167.135 name is %s\n", canonname);
}

</code>

Then we can call the ''ecore_con_lookup()'' function to do the query.

<code c>
// Call ecore_con_lookup.
ret = ecore_con_lookup("140.211.167.135", done_cb, NULL);
// If ret is EINA_FALSE the request failed to set up.
</code>

When the request succeeds it shall call the ''done_cb()'' callback that will
printthe name associated with the IP address we gave.

When the library is not be used anymore, it has to be shut down.

<code c>
// Shutdown the library.
ret = ecore_con_shutdown();
</code>
