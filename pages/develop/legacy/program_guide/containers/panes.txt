==== Creating a Panes ====

To create a panes widget, use the ''elm_panes_add()'' function:

<code c>
Evas_Object *panes = elm_panes_add(parent);
</code>

==== Adding Content to the Panes ====

To add content to the panes, use the ''elm_object_part_content_set()'' function.
The following code adds an object to the left pane:

<code c>
elm_object_part_content_set(panes, "left", obj);
</code>

Here, the Default content parts of the panes widget that you can use are:

  * ''"left"'' - A leftside content of the panes
  * ''"right"'' - A rightside content of the panes
  * ''"top"'' - A top content of the vertical panes
  * ''"bottom"'' - A bottom content of the vertical panes

If panes are displayed vertically, left content will be displayed on top.

==== Setting Panes Options ====

To set the orientation of the panes, use the ''elm_panes_horizontal_set()''
function.

To set the size of the panes, use the ''elm_panes_content_left_size_set()'' and
''elm_panes_content_right_size_set()'' functions.

==== Signals ====

The panes widget emits the following signals:

  * ''"press"'': The panes widget has been pressed (but the press has not been released yet).
  * ''"unpress"'': The press has been released.
  * ''"clicked"'': The panes widget has been clicked.
  * ''"clicked,double"'': The panes widget has been double-clicked.
