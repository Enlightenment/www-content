~~Title: Widgets Programming Guide~~
{{page>index}}
===== Widgets Programming Guide =====

The Elementary library is a simple toolkit. It provides several widgets than
can be used to compose the user interface of your application. Widgets allow
you to build your application without having to reinvent basic objects, such
as buttons, lists, or text entries. Widgets will often generate signals that
can be caught in the application when the user interacts with the widgets.
This guide teaches you the basics of Elementary, describes selected concepts
of the Elementary configuration framework, and describes the most common
widgets.

==== Elementary Basics ====

In this chapter, we explain how widgets are built in a hierarchical manner,
how to build a minimal Elementary application, and what the differences are
between the callbacks that can be registered for widgets.

==== Elementary Configuration ====

Elementary can be configured using profiles. This chapter details some
configuration items that can be modified to tweak the use of Elementary.

==== Widgets ====

++++Background|
The background widget can be used to set a solid background decoration to a
window or a container object. It works like an image, but has some background
specific properties, such as setting it to tiled, centered, scaled, or
stretched.

UI items.
++++

++++Label|

List  The list widget is a very simple list for managing a small number of
items. If you need to manage a lot of items, use the genlist widget instead.
++++

++++Map|
The map widget can display a geographic map. The default map data is
provided by the OpenStreetMap project (http://www.openstreetmap.org/).
++++

++++Notify|  The notify widget displays a container in a specific region of the
parent object. It can receive some content, and it can be automatically hidden
after a certain amount of time.
++++

++++Panel|
The panel widget is an animated object that can contain child objects.
It can be expanded or contracted by clicking on the button on its edge.

The photo widget can be used to display a photo, such as a contact
image. If no photo is set, the widget displays a person icon to show that it
is a photo placeholder.
++++

++++Photocam|
The photocam widget is designed to display high-resolution photos
taken with a digital camera. It allows you to zoom photos, load photos fast,
and fit photos. It is optimized for JPEG images and has a low memory
footprint.
++++

++++Plug|
The plug widget allows you to show an Evas object created by another
process. It can be used anywhere like any other Elementary widget.
++++

++++Popup|
The popup widget shows a pop-up area that can contain a title area, a

alone.
