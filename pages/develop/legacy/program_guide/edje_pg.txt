This programming guide shows you how to write an EDC file that can be used to
theme a EFL application. It describes concepts about parts positioning and
resizing. It also explains part animations that can be done through programs.

==== Quick How-tos ====

=== Adding Element on Screen ===

Add a new part inside the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block|parts block]].

=== Using Image  ===

List the image in the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/edje_blocks#Images_Block|images
block]], make sure the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block|part]] has type
"IMAGE" and set the normal property inside
[[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Image|description.image]] of part.

=== Using Same Color Definitions Across Multiple Elements ===

Define a [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/edje_bloks#Color_classes_Block|color class]]
and set the
[[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Description|description.color_class]]
property.

=== Positioning or Resizing a Part (Relative and Absolute Positioning) ===

Fill in the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Rel1/rel2|rel1 and rel2]]
structures inside the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Description|description
block]].

=== Hiding Part ===

Set the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Description|visible property]] to 0.

=== Animating Part ===

Create several [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Description|description
blocks]] inside your [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block|part]] and give each of
them a different value for state.  Set one description for the initial state
and one for the end state.

Create a [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/program#Program|program]] with an action that
is STATE_SET "end_state" 0.0; and with a target that is the name of the part.
You can also set a non-default transition.

When defining the second [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block#Description|description
]], inherit from the first part in order to
re-use the values which are already defined.

The after property of the [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/program#Program|program
block]] is used to trigger another program after the animation is done. It can
be used to trigger another animation or to emit a signal to the C part of the
program.

=== Making Genlist Item Theme ===

Create a [[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/group_block|Group Block]] with one
[[/develop/legacy/program_guide/edje/part_block|part element]] for each part that can be
filed from the C code and set the items properties inside the group
element:

<code c>
items: "texts" "text_part_1 text_part_2";
items: "icons" "image_part_1 image_part_2";
</code>

On the C side, the ''text_get'' and ''content_get'' callback are called
respectively with ''text_part_1'' and ''text_part_2'', and ''image_part_1''
and ''image_part_2''.
