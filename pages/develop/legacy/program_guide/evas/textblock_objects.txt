===== Textblock Objects =====

Unlike basic text objects, a textblock handles complex text, managing multiple
styles and multiline text based on HTML-like tags. However, these extra
features are heavier on memory and processing cost.

The textblock objects is an object that shows big chunks of text. Textblock
supports many features, including text formatting, automatic and manual text
alignment, embedding items (icons, for example). Textblock has three important
parts: the text paragraphs, the format nodes and the cursors.

To set markup to format text, use for example
''<font_size=50>Big!</font_size>''. Set more than one style
directive in one tag with ''<font_size=50 color=#F00>Big and
Red!</font_size>''. Please note that we used ''</font_size>''
although the format also included color. This is because the first format
determines the matching closing tag's name. You can use anonymous tags, such
as ''<font_size=30>Big</>'', which pop any type of format, but it
is advisable to use the named alternatives instead.

Textblock supports the following formats:

   * ''font'': Font description in fontconfig such as format, for example "Sans:style=Italic:lang=hi". or "Serif:style=Bold".
   * ''font_weight'': Overrides the weight defined in "font". For example, "font_weight=Bold" is the same as "font=:style=Bold". The supported weights are "normal", "thin", "ultralight", "light", "book", "medium", "semibold", "bold", "ultrabold", "black", and "extrablack".

   * ''align'': The text alignment in one of the following formats: "auto" (according to text direction), "left", "right", "center" or "middle", which take a value between 0.0 and 1.0 or a value between 0% to 100%.
   * ''valign'': The vertical text alignment in one of the following formats: "top", "bottom", "middle", "center", "baseline" or "base", which take a value between 0.0 and 1.0 or a value between 0% to 100%.
