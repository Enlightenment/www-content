===== Clipping Objects =====

==== Limiting Visibility  ====

An Evas object can be clipped â€“ in other words, its visible area is restricted
with the clipper object.

It is often necessary to show only parts of an object, and while it may be
possible to create an object that corresponds only to the part that must be
shown (which is not always possible), it is usually easier to use a clipper. A
clipper is a rectangle that defines what is visible and what is not. The way
to do this is to create a solid white rectangle (by default, so you need not
use ''evas_object_color_set()'') and give it a position and size of what is
wanted visible. The following code exemplifies showing the center half of
my_evas_object:

<code c>
Evas_Object *clipper = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas_canvas);
evas_object_move(clipper, my_evas_object_x / 4, my_evas_object_y / 4);
evas_object_resize(clipper, my_evas_object_width / 2, my_evas_object_height / 2);
evas_object_clip_set(my_evas_object, clipper);
evas_object_show(clipper);
</code>

==== Layer of Color  ====

A solid white clipper does not produce a change in the color of the clipped
object, only hides what is outside the clipper's area.  Changing the color of
an object is accomplished by using a colored clipper. Clippers with color
function by multiplying the colors of the clipped object. The following code
shows how to remove all the red from an object.

<code c>
Evas_Object *clipper = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);
evas_object_move(clipper, my_evas_object_x, my_evas_object_y);
evas_object_resize(clipper, my_evas_object_width, my_evas_object_height);
evas_object_color_set(clipper, 0, 255, 255, 255);
evas_object_clip_set(obj, clipper);
evas_object_show(clipper);
</code>
