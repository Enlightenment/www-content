~~Title: Drop and Bounce Effects - Ecore Animator~~
//**__previous page__: **//[[/tutorial/effects/ecore_animator/zoom|Creating a zoom effect]]
==== Creating Drop and Bounce Effects ====

To finish, we add drop and bounce effects to our buttons at application start.

{{ :ecore_animator_start.gif }}

To do this, we create one timeline per button after creating the buttons in
''elm_main()'':

<code c>
//drop and bounce effects
ecore_animator_timeline_add(2, _do_drop, bt1);
ecore_animator_timeline_add(2.3, _do_drop, bt2);
ecore_animator_timeline_add(2.5, _do_drop, bt3);
</code>

We call the same ''_do_drop()'' animation callback function for each timeline.
In this callback, instead of using an Evas Map, we simply change the position
of the target using the ''evas_object_move()'' function:

<code c>
static Eina_Bool
_do_drop(void *data, double pos)
{
   Evas_Object *obj = data;
   int x, y, w, h;
   double frame = pos;
   frame = ecore_animator_pos_map(pos, ECORE_POS_MAP_BOUNCE, 2, 4);

   evas_object_geometry_get(obj, &x, &y, &w, &h);
   evas_object_move(obj, x, 600 * frame);

   return EINA_TRUE;
}
</code>

To get the bounce effect, we use the ''ecore_animator_pos_map()'' function,
which maps an input position from 0.0 to 1.0 along the timeline to a position
on a different curve. The curve can be of different types, such as ''LINEAR'',
''SINUSOIDAL'', and ''BOUNCE''. This function takes the following arguments:

  * The input position to map
  * The mapping to use (''LINEAR'', ''SINUSOIDAL'', and so on)
  * v1, which is the first parameter used by the mapping
  * v2, which is the second parameter used by the mapping

The ''ECORE_POS_MAP_BOUNCE'' map we use starts at 0.0, then drops like a ball
bouncing to the ground at 1.0, bouncing v2 times with a decay factor of v1.
Here, we bounce 4 times with a decay factor of 2:

<code c>
frame = ecore_animator_pos_map(pos, ECORE_POS_MAP_BOUNCE, 2, 4);
</code>
This frame is used in the move function to create the animation. The value
increases on each ''_do_drop()'' call along the timeline, which produces a
nice drop of the buttons from their initial position to 600 pixels on the
vertical axis.
