~~Title: Genlist Tutorial~~
==== Genlist Tutorial ====

This tutorial deals with Elementary genlist, a list widget for large sets of
elements.  Its API to populate entries reflects that as it uses callbacks.

Also keep in mind that the same widget handles both flat lists and trees and
this is obviously seen in the API.

=== Initialize the Application  ===

The code below shows a typical Elementary application that creates a window
entitled "Genlist Basic Tutorial". The genlist goes inside.

<code c>
#include <Elementary.h>

EAPI_MAIN int
elm_main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    Evas_Object *win;

    win = elm_win_util_standard_add("Genlist", "Genlist Basic Tutorial");
    elm_policy_set(ELM_POLICY_QUIT, ELM_POLICY_QUIT_LAST_WINDOW_CLOSED);
    elm_win_autodel_set(win, EINA_TRUE);
    //win 400x400 px
    evas_object_resize(win, 400, 400);

    //GENLIST here

    evas_object_show(win);
    elm_run();
    return 0;
}
ELM_MAIN()
