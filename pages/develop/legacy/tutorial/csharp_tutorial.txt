==== Getting Started ====

=== Prerequisite ===

Before you start you may want to read about how to compile the EFL:

    * Installed from source: [[develop/efl/start|Get started with EFL]].

=== Dependencies ===

== Linux ==

You will need a compatible version of [[http://www.mono-project.com|Mono]] (4.0 or higher).
The paths to the ''mcs'' compiler and to the ''mono'' application must be in the ''PATH'' environment variable before compiling.

Once all conditions are met proceed to ??Compilation??.

== Windows ==

In order to have EFL on a Windows environment we highly recommend following [[https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/windows/|this guide]] which accomplishes that using win-builds and MSYS2.

To compile and run the C# binding, you can use [[http://www.mono-project.com|Mono]] (4.0 or higher) binaries installed directly to your Windows system (i.e. outside the MSYS2 environment), you will just need to make sure that the paths to the ''mcs.exe'' compiler and to the ''mono.exe'' application are in the ''PATH'' environment variable in your MSYS2 terminal.
Using the default installation path, Mono binaries normally goes in ''C:\Program Files\Mono''; in MSYS2 you can point to this location using the path ''/c/Program Files/Mono/bin''.
You can also permanently set this in your ''/etc/profile'' in MSYS2 adding something like this at the end of the file:
<code>
export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/Mono/bin"
</code>
If you used another installation path to Mono just adjust the paths used.

Once all conditions are met proceed to ??Compilation??.

In both Windows and Linux environments just
