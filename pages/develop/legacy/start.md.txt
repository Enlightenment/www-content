# Developing with Stable EFL

This section covers the documentation and guides that are part of our current stable API. Whilst most active development is focused on our BETA APIs the majority of our apps are still written using the stable (which will become legacy) APIs.

## Tutorials

There are a collection of tutorials for using the Stable API listed on the [EFL Tutorials](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/tutorial/) page. These cover the most common tasks or workflows within EFL. You will find assistance working with animations, multimedia, user interfaces and 3D.

## Programming Guides

The underlying concepts and main modules all have programming guides as well. They are all referenced from the [Stable API Programming Guide](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/program_guide/) home page.

## Examples

The examples for the stable API are included in our source distribution and can be browsed at our [git repository](https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/src/examples/).
