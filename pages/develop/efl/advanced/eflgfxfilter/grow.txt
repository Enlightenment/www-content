==== Grow and shrink ====

The ''grow'' function is used to apply [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology|morphology]] filters to a buffer.

<note>At the moment, ''grow'' is implemented with a combinaison of ''blur'' and ''curve'' instead of a classical structuring element, which means that the growing and shrinking effects are not exactly the same as the mathematical dilation or erosion.</note>

== Syntax ==
<code Lua>
grow ({ radius, smooth = true, src = input, dst = output })
</code>

== Parameters ==
|''radius'' |The radius of the grow kernel. If a negative value is specified, the contents will shrink rather than grow. |
|''smooth'' |If true, use a smooth transitions between black and white (smooth blur and smoother curve). |
|''src'' |Source buffer to blur. |
|''dst'' |Destination buffer for blending. This must be of same size and colorspace as ''src''. |

== Examples ==
<code Lua>
a = buffer { 'rgba' }
blend { dst = a }
grow { 6, src = a }
</code>

<code Lua>

blend { dst = a }
grow { -4, src = a }
