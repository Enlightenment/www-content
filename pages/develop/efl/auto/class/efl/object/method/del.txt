===== C signature =====

<code c>
void efl_del(const Eo *obj);
</code>

===== Description =====

%%Unrefs the object and reparents it to NULL.%%

%%Because efl_del() unrefs and reparents to NULL, it doesn't really delete the object.%%

%%This method accepts a const object for convenience, so all objects could be passed to it easily.%%
