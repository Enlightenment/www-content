===== Description =====

%%Make the canvas discard as much data as possible used by the engine at runtime.%%

%%This function will unload images, delete textures and much more, where possible. You may also want to call %%[[:docs:efl:auto:class:evas:canvas:method:render_idle_flush|Evas.Canvas.render_idle_flush]]%% immediately prior to this to perhaps discard a little more, though this function should implicitly delete most of what %%[[:docs:efl:auto:class:evas:canvas:method:render_idle_flush|Evas.Canvas.render_idle_flush]]%% might discard too.%%
