===== Description =====

%%Returns whether the default mouse pointer is logically inside the canvas.%%

%%When this function is called it will return a value of either %%''false''%% or %%''true''%%, depending on if event_feed_mouse_in or event_feed_mouse_out have been called to feed in a  mouse enter event into the canvas.%%

%%A return value of %%''true''%% indicates the mouse is logically inside the canvas, and %%''false''%% implies it is logically outside the canvas.%%

%%A canvas begins with the mouse being assumed outside (%%''false''%%).%%

%%If %%''e''%% is not a valid canvas, the return value is undefined.%%
