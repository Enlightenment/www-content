===== Description =====

%%Layout function which sets the box o to a homogeneous horizontal box%%

%%In a homogeneous horizontal box, its width is divided equally between the contained objects. The box's overall behavior is controlled by its padding/alignment properties, which are set by the evas_object_box_{h,v}_{align,padding}_set family of functions.  The size hints the elements in the box -- set by the evas_object_size_hint_{align,padding,weight}_set functions -- also control the way this function works.%%

%%Box's properties: %%''align_h''%% has no influence on the box for this layout. %%''padding_h''%% tells the box to draw empty spaces of that size, in pixels, between the (equal) child objects' cells. The %%''align_v''%% and %%''padding_v''%% properties of the box don't contribute to its behaviour when this layout is chosen.%%

%%Child element's properties: %%''padding_l''%% and %%''padding_r''%% sum up to the required width of the child element. The %%''align_x''%% property tells the relative position of this overall child width in its allocated cell ($0.0 to extreme left, $1.0 to extreme right). A value of $-1.0 to %%''align_x''%% makes the box try to resize this child element to the exact width of its cell (respecting the minimum and maximum size hints on the child's width and accounting for its horizontal padding hints). The child's %%''padding_t''%%, %%''padding_b''%% and %%''align_y''%% properties apply for padding/alignment relative to the overall height of the box. A value of $-1.0 to %%''align_y''%% makes the box try to resize this child element to the exact height of its parent (respecting the maximum size hint on the child's height).%%
