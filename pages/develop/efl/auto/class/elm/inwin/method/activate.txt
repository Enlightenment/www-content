%%Activates an inwin object, ensuring its visibility%%

%%This function will make sure that the inwin %%''obj''%% is completely visible by calling evas_object_show() and evas_object_raise() on it, to bring it to the front. It also sets the keyboard focus to it, which will be passed onto its content.%%

%%The object's theme will also receive the signal "elm,action,show" with source "elm".%%
