# Eina Programming Guide - Tools #

The ``Eina`` library provides a range of tools for handling common tasks. The following tools are documented:

## String Tool ##

[The String Tool](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/guides/c/eina/tools/eina-string-tool.md) offers a range of string-handling capabilities from conversion to or from upper or lower case, splitting, joining, and matching strings.

## Memory Pools ##

[The Memory Pool Tool](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/guides/c/eina/tools/eina-mempool.md) provides simple handling of memory pools, designed to preallocate fixed-size memory spaces and simplify memory management tasks.

## Safety Checks ##

[The Safety Checks](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/guides/c/eina/tools/eina-safety-checks.md) are a collection of macros designed to check for parameters or values which must never occur, in a similar manner to the ``assert()`` function but with logging and returning capabilities rather than outright abortion.
