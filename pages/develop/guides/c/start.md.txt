# Beta API C Programming Guides #

This section of the Enlightenment Wiki offers reference guides for the most commonly-used features of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) and associated infrastructure. These guides are designed to supplement and support the step-by-step tutorials, which are written as a starting point for beginners who have not previously programmed using EFL.

> **NOTE:**
> The guides in this section use the latest beta release of the API, as noted in [Developing with the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/start.md#Current_vs._Beta). Versions of these guides written for the current release can be found in the [Legacy section of the website](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/program_guide/start).
