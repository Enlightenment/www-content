# Developer Guides - C#

This section of the Enlightenment Wiki offers reference guides for the most commonly-used features of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) and associated infrastructure as applied to the C programming language. These guides are designed to supplement and support the step-by-step tutorials, which are in turn designed as a starting point for beginners who have not previously programmed using EFL.

This section contains developer guides for those programming in the C language; for other supported languages consult the [main Developer Guides page](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/guides/start.md).

## Legacy Guides ##

The documentation of EFL and its infrastructure is an ongoing effort, taking place alongside the roll-out of a new version of the application programming interface (API). The documentation in this section is verified as applicable to the new API; for guidance on the old API, known as the *legacy API*, consult the [Legacy Programming Guide](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/legacy/program_guide/start).

## Eina Programming Guide ##

[The Eina Programming Guide](https://www.enlightenment.org/develop/guides/c/eina/start.md) provides a quick reference and code examples for the ``Eina`` library, which is designed to implement an API for data types in an efficient manner and which comes with tools for common tasks.
