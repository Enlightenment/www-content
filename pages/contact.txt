Many of the core developers involved in Enlightenment as well as a lot
of users are on IRC. They use IRC often and will discuss many
development issues there instead of e-mail, due to it having immediate
feedback as well as convenient shared discussion channels.

We use the Freenode IRC network, and you will find us on the #e
channel. You can use a, IRC client like X-Chat, Konversation, Pidgin,
and many others. If your client already has a listing for
freenode, just select it. If not just set up the server as
irc.freenode.net as your server with the normal IRC port of 6667. Once
connected just join #e (you can just type in the command: /join #e
then Enter). Just type + press Enter to talk.

^Mailing List ^Archive ^Comment^
|[[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-users|Users]]|[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=enlightenment-users|Archive]]| |
|[[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-devel|Developers]]|[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=enlightenment-devel|Archive]]| |
|[[git@lists.enlightenment.org|Git Commits]]|[[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=enlightenment-git|Old Archive]]|Mail [[git+subscribe@lists.enlightenment.org]] with **"subscribe"** (no quotes) in the message body|

Our primary non-realtime form of communication is via e-mail. This
allows everyone to participate no matter what timezone the live in or
what waking hours they keep. It allows for streamlined access via your
favorite e-mail application, which should handle large volumes of
messages and conversations well already. It allows for off-line
reading and replies (unlike web forums or IRC),

The language used on our mailing lists is English. It is a universal
language that more people speak than any other, so if you want to
participate, please use English, and then everyone can understand and
respond. Also note that these lists are public and everyone sees the
e-mails sent to them, and anyone may respond. Not all answers will be
correct, but the vast majority will be.

In addition to the lists being a forum for questions, suggestions and
other such discussions, they are also used as a news feed. Especially
our [[git@lists.enlightenment.org|commits mailing list]].
Every piece of code changed, bug fixed, or feature added will be
broadcast on our commits mailing list. If you want to know what is
going on, our commits list is an absolute must to subscribe to.

We have 3 main lists.
[[git@lists.enlightenment.org|The GIT Commits List]] is
for sending out notices of every commit that happens to our
repositories, with full source diffs, log and who did the work.
[[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-devel|The Devel List]]
is where most of the developer and development discussions happen.
This list will be more technical that the
[[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-users|Users List]].
The Users List is where regular user discussions will happen.

[[http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-intl|The Intl List]]
is for posting changes to internationalization like updated PO files.

==== Bugs ====

We use [[https://phab.enlightenment.org|Phabricator]] for our bug
tracking and Wiki. If you have a bug or issue, please Report a bug.
We will eventually get to it, but try and assign it to someone
appropriate so it gets attention.

Please use [[https://phab.enlightenment.org/maniphest|Maniphest]]
for bugs, not for discussions or feature requests or for "I don't
know how to do this" questions. It's for reporting actual problems.
For questions we have E-Mail and IRC. Also remember that we will
prioritize bug fixing to those things that are core, urgent or
necessary, so just because a report isn't acted on soon, doesn't
mean we won't eventually get to it. Once it's in the system it
won't disappear. It just takes it being noticed.

We have a wiki-based primary website (this one), and a "technical
wiki" over on Phabricator. It happens to be split this way simply due
to history and that this wiki here is newer, replacing static web pages.
