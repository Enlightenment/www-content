Edi is a development environment designed for and built using the EFL.
Our aim is to create a new, native development environment for Linux that makes getting up and running easier than ever before. With so much happening on Linux both on the desktop and on mobile we want to help more developers get involved in the exciting future of open source development.

=== Features ===

Building an IDE is a huge task so we have broken down the features into
phases. We have completed "Basic text editing" and are working on
"Code aware editor". Once that is done "Basic IDE" will commence. More details are available on the [[https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/projects/edi/|project page]].

So far the main features include:

  * Syntax highlighting
  * Auto suggestion for C files and headers
  * Tabbed browsing of open files
  * Build management and test runner
  * Search & replace in file
  * Displaying file browser for the project (directory)
  * No screen waste (toolbar, menu, tab are out of the way of the developer)
  * Creation of new projects from name input and skeleton project files

If you have ideas for features please let us know in the #edi-ide room on irc.freenode.net.
