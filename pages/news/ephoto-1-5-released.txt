=== Ephoto 1.5 Released ===
  * //2017-08-22 - by Stephen M Houston//

Ephoto 1.5 has been released and it is available at the following links:
[[http://www.smhouston.us/stuff/ephoto-1.5.tar.gz]]
[[http://www.smhouston.us/stuff/ephoto-1.5.tar.xz]]

This is a bugfix release that also contains a slight change to the interface of Ephoto.  The main interface is no longer using the translucent overlay panels for file browsing and such.  It is now using standard elementary widgets and no longer hovers over other items hiding your images.  This release also fixes the issues with compiling and running Ephoto with EFL 1.20.  This release will bridge the gap between 1.0 and 2.0.

Ephoto is a comprehensive image/photo viewer written in C and using the Enlightened Foundation Libraries.  The application supports file system browsing for photos and images, enhancement and editing features, and moving slideshows.
