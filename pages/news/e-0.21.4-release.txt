== Building and Dependencies ==

If you have an existing EFL or Elementary install, you may wish to delete its header files and libraries before compiling and installing to avoid possible conflicts during compilation. Please compile the dependencies in the following order (click for README):

  - [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/README  *   *   *    | EFL]]

**Note:** E21 depends on EFL **v1.17** or newer for X11 compositing although  v1.18 is recommended and v1.18 is required for Wayland support.
