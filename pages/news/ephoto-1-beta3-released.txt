=== Ephoto 1.0 Beta3 ===
  * //2017-03-29 - by Stephen M Houston//

Ephoto 1.0 Beta3 is now available for download. This comes several months after beta2.  There was overwhelming support and requests following the second beta.  The largest part of this feedback was that the transparent overlapping panels that auto-hid would be better served as normal style panels that didnâ€™t overlap.  This was a fairly large change and thus with the pending release of EFL 1.19, a third and final beta was ultimately the best way to proceed.  This will be the final beta and the official release will happen in tandem with EFL 1.19.

Please test this release and reporting any bugs or feedback to http://phab.enlightenment.org.
