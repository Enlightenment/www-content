=== EFL 1.21.0 betaa 1 ===
  * //2018-07-25 - by Stefan Schmidt//

This first beta release for 1.21 brings a number of fixes over the alpha release. A working wayland build from the tarballs for example. We still have some open issues before we can go further with the release. We appreciate any tester of this to let us know about problems. This goes for packaging, testing with efl based applications, integration into your systems, etc.
