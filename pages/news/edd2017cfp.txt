=== Enlightenment Developer Days 2017 Call for Papers ===
  * //2017-04-28 - by Stefan Schmidt//

This years edition of the annual Enlightenment developer gathering will 
take place Saturday 24th and Sunday 25th of June, 2017 in Valletta, Malta.

For more information and registration (free, but needed due to limited 
seats) see our event page.

https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/events/enlightenment_developer_days_2017/

If you want to propose a talk, a hands on session, a hackathon theme or
something else please send a mail to efl-dev-day-cfp@lists.s-osg.org .
Title and short abstracts would be good as well as the time you expect
it will take. The same address can be used to request a VISA invitation
letter which might be needed for some folks.

For this year, we think we are going to reproduce the same principle as 
last year with the morning dedicated to presentation and talk, the 
afternoon to small group hacking and discussion session. There is a 
potential to dedicate the late afternoon of Saturday for talk targeted 
to user. We may dedicate 1 or 2 hours total for that just before heading 
to dinner. So if someone want to present something for users, that would 
be a good time.

Please give us plenty of time handling them by submitting your request
early. The deadline for the Call for Participation is May 29 2017.
