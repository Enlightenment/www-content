The packages is also available on pypi, to install just use:

For convenience the tarballs contain both the Cython sources and generated intermediary C sources, meaning you **do not** need Cython to compile the bindings. Full cython sources are also publicly accessible from our git repository at:
https://git.enlightenment.org/bindings/python/python-efl.git/

More information about the python bindings can be found at:
https://phab.enlightenment.org/w/projects/python_bindings_for_efl/

== What's New ===

As always new features of EFL 1.18 have been ported and the usual has been done in fixing bugs, optimizing speed and improve documentation.  (see **ChangeLog** in the tarball for the full list of changes)

== Building and Dependencies ==

If you have existing Python-EFL installed you may wish to uninstall them before compiling and installing to avoid possible conflicts during install and/or runtime.

To build the bindings you will need the following libraries:
  * python (Python 2.6+/3.2+)
  * efl (1.18)
  * python-dbus (0.83+)


If you wish to compile using the Cython sources a required dependency is:
  * cython (0.21+)


To install the bindings run:

''(sudo) python setup.py install''

To generate the documentation locally you need:
  * sphinx (1.1+)
  * graphviz (optional)

To build the documentation:

''python setup.py build_doc''

For more information on available build options see:

''python setup.py --help''
