== Building and Dependencies ==

  - [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/README                     | EFL]]
  - xcb
  - xcb-shape
  - xcb-keysyms
  - libpam (Linux only)

Highly recommended to ensure proper functionality (though you can live
without these):

  - connman (For network configuration support)
  - bluez5 (For bluetooth configuration and control)
  - bc (For the evrything module calculator mode)
  - pulseaudio (For proper audio device control and redirection)
  - acpid (For systems with ACPI for lid events, AC/Battery plug in/out etc.)
  - packagekit (For the built in system updates monitoring and updater)
  - udisks2 (For removable storage mounting/unmounting)
  - gdb (If you want automatic backtraces on a crash in ~/.e-crashdump.txt - don't forget to build EFL and E with gdb debugging to make this useful)

**Note:** Enlightenment 0.23.0 depends on EFL **v1.22.3** or newer.
