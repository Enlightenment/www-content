== What's New ==

We only cover some highlights here. For the full list please look at the NEWS file,
if you are interested in the details. As usual we have been working on fixing bugs,
optimising our code for speed and memory footprint and adding new features.

== Wayland, DRM and Input ==
The wayland protocol implementations still remains a highly active area in EFL. This cycle we have
seen the addition of an EFL specific hints protocol for setting aspect on surfaces and the support of
xdg-shell vfinal. Our drm2 and libinput usage gained support for setting pointer acceleration speed.

== Edje ==
To aid the, sometimes very hard, debugging of edje files an embryo echo command was added.
It is now also possible to reference images from other edje files. The biggest change however is the
possibility to have edje_cc verify namespace usage during compilation . This also has been enabled in
tree (with the whitelisting of some exceptions we can not change). We hope this will help to avoid
these kind of problems for the future.

== Evas ==
The Eavs subsystem added async canvas text layout functionality and improvements on font
handling. A scale feature for embedded bitmap fonts and support for different H/V font DPI
has been aded. Last but not least we added align=end in textblock for putting a text at the
opposite side of LTR/RTL.

== Elementary ==
A new text on patch widget was introduced this cycle together with a item pin feature in genlist.
Additionally elm_entry was enhanced with a prediction hints API.

== Eolian ==
Eolian improved its parsing in various areas. One being deferred parsing of inherits as well
as better static checks of the given eo files. New API's have been added for part
enumeration and to query information about objects.

  * bullet
  * libpng
  * libjpeg
  * gstreamer (1.x, 0.10 support optional. Ensure all codecs you want are installed.)
  * zlib
  * luajit (lua 5.1 or 5.2 support optional)
  * libtiff
  * openssl
  * curl
  * dbus
  * libc
  * fontconfig
  * freetype2
  * fribidi
  * libpulse
  * libsndfile
  * libx11
  * libxau
  * libxcomposite
  * libxdamage
  * libxdmcp
  * libxext
  * libxfixes
  * libxinerama
  * libxrandr
  * libxrender
  * libxss
  * libxtst
  * libxcursor
  * libxp
  * libxi (2.2 or newer)
  * libgl (opengl/glx or opengl-es2/egl)
  * giflib
  * util-linux (limbount + libblkid)
  * systemd / libudev
  * poppler / poppler-cpp
  * libraw
  * libspectre
  * librsvg

Recommended requirements (highly recommended):

  * harfbuzz
  * libwebp
  * libunwind (where available)

Enable these with configure options:

<file>
--enable-xinput22 \
--enable-systemd \
--enable-image-loader-webp \
--enable-harfbuzz \
--enable-multisense \
--enable-liblz4
</file>

On linux to get framebuffer support you may want to also do:

<file>
--enable-fb
--disable-tslib
</file>

If you want wayland support also add:

<file>
--enable-wayland \
--enable-elput \
--enable-drm
</file>
 
At runtime if you want thumbnailing for DOC/PPT/XLS etc. files also provide:
libreoffice
