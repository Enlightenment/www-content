== Building and Dependencies ==

If you have an existing EFL or Elementary install, you may wish to delete its header files and libraries before compiling and installing to avoid possible conflicts during compilation. Please compile the dependencies in the following order (click for README):

  * [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/README                     | EFL]]
  * [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/elementary.git/tree/README              | Elementary]]
  * [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/emotion_generic_players.git/tree/README | Emotion generic players]]
  * [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/evas_generic_loaders.git/tree/README    | Evas generic loaders]]

**Note:** E20 depends on EFL **v1.15.2** or newer for X11 compositing and 1.17 for Wayland support.
