=== EFL 1.21.0 beta 2 ===
  * //2018-08-09 - by Stefan Schmidt//

This second, and hopefully last, beta release for 1.21 brings a number of fixes over the first beta release. 
The number of known issues shrunk to just a few left overs we are working on right now. We appreciate any tester of this to let us know about problems. This goes for packaging, testing with efl based applications, integration into your systems, etc.
