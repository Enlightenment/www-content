== What's New ==

We only cover some highlights here. For the full list please look at the NEWS file,
if you are interested in the details. As usual we have been working on fixing bugs,
optimising our code for speed and memory footprint and adding new features.

== XCB support removed ==
After many years of having XCB support in ecore_x and the evas engine without a
real user base we decided to drop it from this release onwards. 

== Multiseat support ==
This release saw the first work on multiseat support in evas and edje.

== Evas Image Loaders ==
In the evas image loader BMP got support for region set and PNG for region load.
The PNG saver was extended with support for GRY8/AGRY88 as well and our
async image loading now allows loading the header of an image file async, too.

== Wayland, DRM and Input ==
Our libinput support in elput does now supports new libinput features like
tap-and-drag, drag-log and dwt on touch pads and more. The XDG shell v6
support was added and ecore-drm does now support retrieving the screen
dpi and its rotation and setting gamma of a given output.

== Eolian ==
Eolian support for documentation in EO files has been extended by a large
margin, including a documentation tokenizer and maybe other things to
generate our documentation from the EO files.
