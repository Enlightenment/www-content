**Enlightenment:** for when you might otherwise find yourself being //too// productive.

=Building and Dependencies=

If you have an existing EFL or Elementary install, you may wish to delete its header files and libraries before compiling and installing to avoid possible conflicts during compilation. Please compile the dependencies in the following order (click for README):

# [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git/tree/README|efl]]
# [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/elementary.git/tree/README|elementary]]
# [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/emotion_generic_players.git/tree/README|emotion_generic_players]]
# [[https://git.enlightenment.org/core/evas_generic_loaders.git/tree/README|evas_generic_loaders]]
**Note:** E20 depends on EFL **v1.15.2** or newer for X11 compositing and 1.17 for Wayland support.

Below are links to the project pages for each of the dependencies:
