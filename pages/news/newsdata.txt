Due to changes in an update of Phabricator, we lost all news styling control, and so we have moved news to the main WWW Wiki.

The content goes here. It can be long or short. This is going to at least have a few lines in a single paragraph to see how things go. Define a Headline and the content of the news article you want to create. You may use standard DokuWiki Syntax within the article, it will be recognized and handled accordingly. The link is automatically created but for what reason ever you may want to change it. Take care that you properly set the anchor or the link will jump to the top of the referenced page. There is a small counter on top of the text input area to give you the quantity of entered words.

Now for a second paragraph. Define a Headline and the content of the news article you want to create. You may use standard DokuWiki Syntax within the article, it will be recognized and handled accordingly. The link is automatically created but for what reason ever you may want to change it. Take care that you properly set the anchor or the link will jump to the top of the referenced page. There is a small counter on top of the text input area to give you the quantity of entered words.

And a third short one goes here **some bold text** as well to test
