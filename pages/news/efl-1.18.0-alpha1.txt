=== EFL 1.18.0 alpha 1 ===
  * //2016-07-18 - by Stefan Schmidt//

This alpha release for 1.18 starts the freeze period and stabilization phase for the 1.18 release cycle. As you can see from the list of features and fixes below it is a huge release and it also took as longer as we hoped for.

One of the biggest changes is the merge of the Elementary, Evas generic loaders and Emotion Generic Players libraries into the EFL. From now on you only need one package for all its goodness. :-)
