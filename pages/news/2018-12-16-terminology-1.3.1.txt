=== Terminology 1.3.1 Release ===
  * //2018-12-16 - by Boris Faure//

I was made aware of a [[https://phab.enlightenment.org/T7504|security issue]] in Terminology this morning. I acknowledged the issue and worked on a fix that is now provided in Terminology 1.3.1.

The issue is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability caused by Terminology's special escape codes.  Those can already be disabled in the Settings panel.

== Addition ==
    * Add manpages about Terminology's helpers

== Fixes ==
    * Do not popup unknown media types (security issue)
    * Right-click on hyperlinks no longer crashes

== Download ==
