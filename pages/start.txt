A horizontal rule goes below.

This is the first paragraph of the page. We should test a long one to see how wrapping and other formatting works with it. **Bold Text** works. //Italic Text// also works. __Underlined Text__ is fine as well. ''Monospaced Text'' is there too. <del>Strike-through Text</del> is also not a problem.

  * Item 2
  * Third item

An external link like: [[http://example.com|External Link]] would go here.

And here is an inlined image, centered and scaled to 100px wide.

Sample code snippets and hilights

<code c>
  typedef struct blah Blah;
  int c;
  void function(char *blah) {
    double x;
    x = 10;
  }
</code>

<code lua>
  function hello(x)
    local y
  end
</code>

This should become a link to the [[start]] page. How about the [[blah]] page too.
