==== Source ====

Out source code is developed collaboratively in a pretty typical open
source manner. Our master branches are where all new development goes
into. We try and keep master working and usable daily, as developers
geenerally are living off master themselves and so bugs affect
developers directly and immediately. Sometimes issues happen, but
they tend to get fixed rapidly.

If you want to track the latest and greatest, please see our git
repositories. If you havev issues please refer to our [[contact]]
page to get in touch with us.

All our git repositories are listed on:

  * [[http://git.enlightenment.org|git.enlightenment.org]]
