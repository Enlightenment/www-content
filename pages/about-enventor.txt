=== About Enventor ===

{{:enventor-about.png?&200 |}}

Basically, Enventor view is divided into 2 sections, live view and text view. The live view is the left pane of Enventor window and it previews images corresponding to the part objects of the EDC source code. The text view is the right pane of Enventor window and it contains the EDC source code. Thanks to its realtime updation mechanism, Enventor updates the preview on realtime while you are modifying the source code that helps you to see the result on the spot. Other than that, Enventor provides quite nice fancy functions for you. Before using Enventor, familiarize yourself with the following:

==Using Text View==

Enventor text view mainly supports text editing. You can write and modify EDC source code in this view. Once part sections are written in the text view and the modified EDC source code is saved, preview images corresponding to the part objects of the EDC source code are displayed in the live view.

Text view supports the following features:

  * Auto-complete

To help you write EDC source code, Text view supports auto-complete function which lists the reserved keywords in a contextual pop-up.

When you enter a part of a reserved keyword, a contextual pop-up comes up with a list of keywords beginning with your input string. Choose one keyword with up and down arrow keys and press "Enter". The keyword is selected and a related EDC code snippet is inserted in the text view automatically. In contrast, if you press "Backspace" key, the auto-complete function is cancelled and the contextual pop-up will be dismissed. In addition, you can enable or disable the auto-complete function in the configuration setting.

You can also use auto-complete as context help: press "Ctrl+Space" key combination to show a list of available keywords in the current cursor position context.

  * Candidate list

The EDC script provides a variety of pre-defined keywords including part object types and program action types. To edit the keywords easier, text view supports a candidate list function for the keywords. When you double-click a keyword in the text view, the available candidate keyword list based on the context pops up. If you select one of the candidate keywords, the double-clicked keyword is changed to the selected one.

The candidate list function also helps you to know the available range of the numeric values based on the context. The numeric candidate function shows the range of the available number. While you are dragging the slider, Enventor updates the preview instantly.
