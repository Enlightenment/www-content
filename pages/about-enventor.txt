===A. What is Enventor?===

Enventor, which is also known as a dynamic EDC (Edje Data Collections) Editor, is a EDC script editor tool that supports text editing and previewing functions for the EDC source code.

{{ :enventor-main.png?&300|}}

When your application requires real-time changeable layouts like animated ones, you can write the layout design using EDC script, compile it into EDJ format file, and import it into your application using a UI layout component. You can also write design layouts from simple to complex ones using the EDC script with Enventor. Enventor helps you write EDC script code eaiser and finish your work faster. If you are not familiar with EDC programming, see [https://www.enlightenment.org/program_guide/edje_pg|Edje Programming Guide]] for more information.

Basically, Enventor view is divided into live view and text view. The live view on the left pane previews images corresponding to part objects of the EDC source code. The text view on the right pane contains the EDC source code. Because of its real-time update mechanism, Enventor updates the preview real-time while you modify the source code. Enventor also provides useful functions for you to develop your GUI. Before using Enventor, familiarize yourself with the following functionalities.

===B. GUI Layout===

{{ :enventor-layout.png?&350|}}

Enventor view consists of the file browser, live view, text view, tools and the EDC navigator.

The following figure illustrates the Enventor layout sections.

  * Red: Tools
  * Cyan: File browser
  * Green: Live view
  * Blue: Text view
  * Orange: EDC navigator
  * Purple: Console view
  * White: File tab
  * Yellow: Status view

===C. Text View===

Enventor text view mainly supports text editing. You can write and modify EDC source code in this view. Once the part sections are written in the text view and the modified EDC source code is saved, the preview images corresponding to the part objects of EDC source code are displayed in the live view. Basically, this text editor applies syntax color and auto indentation for EDC with its own coding standard rules. If you open an EDC file which is not matched with Enventor coding standard rule, Enventor applies it to your source code automatically for your convenience. To disable this functionality, go to "Setting -> Preference -> Auto Indentation".

Furthermore, the Text view supports the following features.

{{ :enventor-autocomplete.png?&150|}}


==Auto-complete==

To help you write EDC source code, the Text view supports an auto-complete function which lists the reserved keywords in a contextual pop-up.

When you enter a part of a reserved keyword, a contextual pop-up appears with a list of keywords beginning with your input string. Choose a keyword with the up and down arrow keys and press "Enter". The keyword is selected and a related EDC code snippet is inserted in the text view automatically. In contrast, if you press "Backspace" key, the auto-complete function is cancelled and the contextual pop-up is dismissed. To enable or disable the auto-complete function, go to "Settings -> Preferences -> Auto Completion".

You can also use auto-complete as a context help. Use the "Ctrl+Space" key combination to show a list of available keywords in the current cursor position context.


{{:enventor-candidate.png?&300 |}}

==Candidate list==

The EDC script provides a variety of pre-defined keywords, including part object types and program action types. To easily edit the keywords, the text view supports a candidate list function for the keywords. When you double-click a keyword in the text view, the available candidate keyword list based on the context pops up. If you select one of the candidate keywords, the double-clicked keyword is changed to a selected one.

The candidate list function also helps you to know the available range of numeric values based on the context. The numeric candidate function shows a range of available numbers. when you drag the sliders, Enventor updates the live view instantly.


{{ :enventor-colorselector.png?&150|}}

==Color selector==

To change color values, use the color selector tool. Each time a "color" keyword is double-clicked, it displays the color selector.


==Zooming text==

Zooming in and out in the text view area changes the editor text font size relative to the zoom factor. This action can be done pressing the "Ctrl" key and rolling the mouse wheel up and down while the mouse cursor is placed the text area. To change the font size in the Text Editor Settings, go to Settings -> Text Editor -> Font Size".


===D. EDC Navigator===

{{ :enventor-navigator.png?&300|}}

For easy navigation inside the EDC block, Enventor provides a tree-style visual tool, called EDC Navigator. You can expand and contract tree items and understand the structure of your EDC layout at a glance.

The following sets of blocks are supported in the EDC Navigator.

  * Group
  * Part
  * State
  * Program

To navigate the EDC source code through the EDC Navigator, click an item in the list. The editor cursor in the text view changes its position to the name of selected item. In case of program items in the tree, they provide the play and stop buttons to trigger or stop the programs in Enventor. This helps you to check the programs by seeing the results directly in the tool.

This tool can be enabled or disabled by the "F10" hotkey.


===E. Interactive Feedback===

Enventor has the following ways of providing interactive feedback information when you edit the EDC source code.


{{ :enventor-highlight.png?&250|}}

==Highlighting a Part Object==

To easily identify the part object that you modify, Enventor provides a function for highlighting the preview image corresponding to a part object. Click a part section in the EDC source code and the preview image corresponding to the part object in live view is highlighted. Oppositely, clicking a part object of the preview image in live view moves the editor cursor to the corresponding EDC line in the text view.


{{:enventor-errors.png?&250 |}}

==Detecting Errors==

To quickly notify about an EDC grammar error, Enventor compiles the EDC source code in the background and detects errors whenever the EDC source code is saved. The detected errors are printed in the console view, and an error code is highlighted with an underline in the text view. When errors are detected, the console view is activated automatically. It is deactivated when the errors are fixed. This behavior is only enabled if the Auto Hiding Console mode is enabled in "Settings -> Preference -> Auto Hiding Console". You can change the size of the console view by dragging a pane divider between the text view and the console view. You can also toggle the console view visibility with the "Alt+up" and "Alt+down" shortcut keys.


{{ :enventor-preview.png?&150|}}

==Image Preview==

To easily check the image files you use, the text view provides a function for previewing image files. Write an image keyword and an image file name in the EDC source code and click the image keyword. The preview image pop-up of the clicked image file opens. If other image files are written in a previous or a next line of the previewed image line, you can go to them using the up and down arrow keys or mouse wheel.


{{:enventor-reference.png?&150 |}}

==Reference popup==

Reference popup is a kind of like a manual for EDC keywords that current cursor positioned on. It shows a description of an EDC keyword for the beginners, who don't familiar with the EDC programming script language, by understanding them its syntax. To pop up the reference, Press "F5" key after positioned the editor cursor on any EDC keywords.


===F. Live Edit===

{{ :enventor-liveedit1.png?&250|}}

Enventor also provides mode called live edit to add part objects easier. Click one of the part object buttons in tools to activate live edit mode. After that, you can add a part object using the live edit contextual pop-up and change its position and size by dragging. Once you confirm the new part, a code snippet describing the new part is inserted in the text editor. When the live edit mode is activated, the text view is disabled.

{{:enventor-liveedit2.png?&150 |}}

==Adding a New Part Object==

The tools contain 6 frequently-used part type buttons: Rect, Text, Image, Swallow, Textblock, and Spacer. Click a required part type button, and the corresponding part object appears in the live view.


==Setting Position and Size==

The position and size of a part object in pixels are displayed in the center of the part object preview image. The relative position of the part object is displayed on a top left box and on bottom right box.

The position and size of a part object can be changed by dragging each control point. These control points are placed on each edge of a part object. To move the part object only, drag the object itself. To move the object position by 1 pixel, use the arrow keys.


{{ :enventor-liveedit3.png?&150|}}

==Auto-Aligning==

By default, the live edit mode provides an auto-aligning functionality which helps you place a control point, which you are dragging, near other parts. If the auto-aligning is activated, it highlights a control line with red color when it attaches to another part. Auto-aligning helps you construct a layout quickly and easily. You disable the auto-align functionality instantly by pressing a "Ctrl" while you drag a control point.


{{:enventor-liveedit4.png?&150 |}}

==Fixed Size==

Each part in a layout can be constructed with relative or fixed size. A part with a relative size expands or contracts its size to keep up other parts position and size or a layout size. On the other hand, if a part is constructed with the fixed size, its size does not scale with the other parts or the layout size. When live edit mode is activated, you can find a fixed size tool in the bottom of the live view. You can check fixed size options for width and height if you want the width and height values to be fixed. For more information about scalability concept in EDC, see [[https://www.enlightenment.org/program_guide/scalability/scalability_using_edje|Scalability Using Edje]]


{{ :enventor-liveedit5.png?&150|}}

==Relative Positioning==

In contrast to the fixed size, you can set a new part's position and size relative to other parts. Drag a control point to the edge of other existing parts. Once you release the mouse button, a contextual pop-up pops up. This popup displays a list of candidate parts that you can choose as relative to x and y coordinates to this new part.


==Confirmation and Cancellation==

After you have confirmed a new part, press "Enter" or double-click a mouse button to insert the part object in your layout. The live edit mode is terminated and the text view is enabled again. To cancel the live edit mode any time during editing, press "Esc" or "Backspace" key.


===G. Workspace===

We'd like to propose to set up workspace if your EDC collections are consisted of multiple edc files. The function of Enventor workspace is disabled in default but if you launch Enventor with "-w" command option which specifies a workspace path, then Enventor regards that folder path is workspace directory. Once the workspace is specified, traditional File browser (toggle hotkey, F9) and File tab (toggle hotkey, F11) are available in Enventor so that you could navigate multiple edc files in that tools.


===H. Tool Functions===

Enventor provides useful tool functions. The following table shows the tool buttons at the top of the Enventor window along with their functions. To toggle the tools itself, use the "F7" shortcut key.

===I. Status View===

Enventor displays the status view on the bottom area. This status view provides extra functions. At times, it displays useful informative messages for your control. Most of times, you can change the live view zoom level and live view size. Otherwise, you can check the current mouse position, a name of the focused group and the text editor cursor line position. See the following sections for more information. To toggle the status view itself, use the "F8" hotkey.


{{ :enventor-status.png?&300|}}

==Zooming View==

To change the live view zoom value, you can use a zoom level controller (Slider). Zooming can be done by pressing "Ctrl" and roling the mouse wheel up and down while you place the mouse cursor in the live view area. The range of the zoom is from 0.1x to 5.0x.


==View Size==

When a new group view comes in live view area, it will have a default view size, 300x300. You can change its view size. Click the resize expand button to display a slider to manipulate it. You could control slider indicator using the mouse dragging or the mouse wheel. Each group keeps individual view sizes so when you switch views they may have different view size. Also, you can swap the width and height of the live view instantly. This swap functionality can be used for simulating some scenarios, such as mobile device portrait and landscape modes. To change the default view size, go to "Settings -> Preferences -> View Size".


===J. Templates===

{{ :enventor-template.png?&200|}}

Enventor provides various useful templates for a quick start. To choose a template, open a new file from the main menu. There are many templates designed to make you understand how to use EDC and how to make GUI designs with them. Also, it can bring you some ideas about what you can do with EDC programming. These templates contain simple samples and also practical examples.


===K. Settings===

The Settings window allows you to set and control the Enventor properties. This window contains 3 tabs: Preferences, Text Editor, and EDC Build.


{{:enventor-setting-preference.png?&200 |}}

==Preferences==

Preferences contain occasionally used options in Enventor. Also, it contains some unique function options such as Auto Hiding Console, Smart Redo/Undo, and Error Message Red Alert.

When the Auto Hiding Console option is turned on, Enventor hides the console box automatically when no messages are to be shown after you have fixed all grammatical errors.

When the Smart Undo/Redo option is turned on, Enventor redoes and undoes text word by word. If disabled, redoing and undoing works character by character.

When the Error Message Red Alert option is turned on, Enventor enables the error message red alert effect. When the EDC compilation fails because of a grammatical error, Enventor alerts you with a fading screen effect.
