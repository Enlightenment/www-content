 ~~Title: EFL on FreeBSD~~
==== FreeBSD and E/EFL ====

Enlightenment and EFL are available for multiple versions of FreeBSD:

    * FreeBSD 8
    * FreeBSD 9
    * FreeBSD 10
    * CURRENT

<note tip>
Enlightenment on FreeBSD only has the latest release version currently this is:
</note>
^ Name ^ Version ^ Submited Update ^
| Enlightenment  | 0.19.5          | 0.19.7          |
| EFL   | 1.13.2          | Locked until 1.15.0          |
| Elementary   | 1.13.2          | Locked until 1.15.0        |
| Terminology  | 0.8.8      | Latest       |

==== Installation ====
The way to install Enlightenment is the same between those distributions,
here is an example:
Option: 1
<code bash>
# pkg install enlightenment
</code>

Install Enlightenment and Terminology:
<code bash>
# pkg install enlightenment
# pkg install terminology
</code>

Install EFL only:

<code bash>
# pkg install efl
</code>

Option: 2

You may also compile E/EFL from source using the ports system.
<code bash>
# svn co http://svn.freebsd.org/ports/head /usr/ports
</code>
or
<code bash>
# portsnap fetch extract
</code>

Installing E on FreeBSD using the ports system.
<code bash>
# cd /usr/ports/x11-wm/enlightenment && make install clean
</code>
or
<code bash>
# make -C /usr/ports/x11-wm/enlightenment install clean
</code>

==== TODO ====

Enlightenment on FreeBSD is always looking at ways to improve, mainly to allow users to have both the latest version along with the latest git sources. We plan on having both a normal release as well as a -devel port for both EFL and Enlightenment.
