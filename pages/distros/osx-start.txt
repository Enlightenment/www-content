~~Title: EFL on Mac OS X~~

<note warning>
If you are coming here for Enlightenment (the desktop manager) on Mac OS X... sorry but Enlightenment is not supported on Mac OS X... and it is not planned in a near future (but any help is very welcomed).
</note>

The Enlightenment Foundation's projects mostly targets Linux platforms, therefore not everything work on Mac OS X works the first time. This is due to:
  * the specificities of the Operating System (kernel+userland);
  * the fact there are a very few Enlightened OS X users :-\

This document explains how to install the EFL which are key projects to install anything else made by the Enlightenment Foundation.

====== Setting up the environment ======

You need to have the OS X CLT (Command-Line Tools) first, then install the EFL dependancies. The easiest way is by using a package manager. [[http://brew.sh|Homebrew]] is assumed to be the package manager.

<note important>
The CTL are not bundled with Xcode. Don't assume that they are installed if Xcode is installed.
</note>

To install the CTL, you should process as it follows:
  * download the latest version of Xcode on the Mac App Store;
  * run ''xcode-select --install'' in a terminal to install the CLT.

====== Mac OS X Homebrew Packages (not advised) ======

<note important>
Mac OS X packages are outdated. They might work, but you SHOULD instead consider manual installation since EFL on Mac OS X are still experimental.
</note>

Since mid-April 2015, Leif Middelschulte provided Homebrew formulas for:
  * EFL 1.14.y
  * Elementary 1.14.y
  * evas-generic-loaders 1.14.y

See at http://brew.sh how to install Homebrew if it isn't already installed.
Then, just execute :

<code bash>
brew update                       # Just to refresh homebrew
brew install efl                  # To install EFL
brew install elementary           # To install Elementary
brew install evas-generic-loaders # To install evas-generic-loaders
</code>

====== Manual Installation (recommanded) ======

If you want to have the very latest version of EFL, here is the procedure:
  * install the dependancies;
  * configure the source;
  * compile the sources and install them.

===== Dependancies with Homebrew =====

<code bash>
brew install autoconf automake libtool autoconf-archive gettext check pkg-config luajit jpeg freetype fribidi fontconfig giflib libtiff glib dbus libsndfile bullet libspectre libraw librsvg poppler gstreamer gst-plugins-good pulseaudio
brew migrate dbus
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/dbus/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist
</code>

You need to add ''autopoint'' to your ''$PATH'' if you want to use gettext. Write the line below in your ''$HOME/.profile'' or similar file.

<code bash>
export PATH="$(brew --prefix gettext)/bin:$PATH"
</code>

===== OpenSSL handling =====

Since Mac OS X El Capitan, Apple does not distribute OpenSSL headers anymore.
It is necessary to install OpenSLL manually through homebrew:

<code bash>
brew install openssl
brew link openssl --force
</code>

and to add flags to your bashrc (or equivalent):

<code bash>
export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include $CFLAGS"
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib $LDFLAGS"
</code>

===== Modifying your linker flags =====

<note>
This step is **required** if you wish to build Mac OS X App Bundles (i.e. ''.app''). Otherwise, you can safely ignore this section.
</note>

''osx-packager'' is a python package initially developed at Open Wide to
generate App Bundles and/or DMG files for easy distribution.
It is available at [[https://git.enlightenment.org/devs/jayji/osx-packager.git]].

To make it work, you **MUST** provide custom linker flags:

<code bash>
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names ${LDFLAGS}"
</code>

===== Configuring, Building and Installing EFL =====

Installing dependancies on OS X is painful, but now you did it (congrats'), you can grab the sources from the git repository:

<code bash>
git clone git://git.enlightenment.org/core/efl.git # Get the sources
cd efl # Go to repository you cloned
./autogen.sh --disable-cxx-bindings
make -j $(nproc) # Compile
sudo make -j $(nproc) install # Install
</code>
