==== openSUSE ====

Enlightenment and EFL are available for multiple versions of openSUSE:
 
    * openSUSE_13.1 (expected end of life Jan. 2016; Evergreen support ends Nov. 2016)
    * openSUSE_13.2
    * openSUSE_Factory
    * openSUSE_Factory_ARM
    * openSUSE_Leap_42.1
    * openSUSE_Tumbleweed      

Installing Enlightenment, is easy on openSUSE!

First get the repository on your system. The openSUSE version will be auto-detected by zypper:
<code bash>
#as root
zypper addrepo -f obs://build.opensuse.org/X11:Enlightenment:Factory enlightenment
zypper -n refresh enlightenment
</code>

Now you can install the Enlightenment pattern (openSUSE meta-package):
<code bash>
zypper install -t pattern enlightenment
</code>

If you want to install EFL only:

<code bash>
zypper install efl
</code>

<note tip>
