~~Title: openSUSE~~
==== openSUSE ====

Enlightenment and EFL are available for multiple versions of openSUSE:
 
    * openSUSE_13.1
    * openSUSE_13.2
    * openSUSE_Factory
    * openSUSE_Factory_ARM
    * openSUSE_Leap_42.1
    * openSUSE_Tumbleweed      

The way to install Enlightenment is similar between those distributions,
here is an example with Tumbleweed:
<code bash>
#as root
zypper addrepo -f obs://build.opensuse.org/X11:Enlightenment:Factory enlightenment
zypper -n refresh enlightenment
</code>

Install Enlightenment (including Terminology):
<code bash>
zypper install -t pattern enlightenment
</code>

Install EFL only:

<code bash>
zypper install efl
</code>

You can also use the one click installer: 
<note warning>Last time I tried this it was broken (Simon Lees, June 2015, On my todo list)</note>
<code bash>
export DISTRO_NAME="openSUSE_Tumbleweed"
wget http://software.opensuse.org/ymp/X11:Enlightenment:Factory/${DISTRO_NAME}/efl.ymp
