# Developer Contributions #

The Enlightenment Project is always keen to accept contributions of code, patches, and other fixes from developers. Whether you're looking to implement a feature or simply fix a typo your contributions will be warmly received, and will help to make the Enlightenment ecosystem as polished as it can possibly be.

Before contributing, please take the time to read through the following documentation.

## Coding Conventions ##

To ensure an approachable and maintainable code base the Enlightenment Project has a document outlining [Coding Conventions](https://www.enlightenment.org/contrib/devs/coding-conventions.md), from the use of spaces rather than tabs through to naming conventions.

While all code contributions are welcomed, code which does not follow the [Coding Conventions](https://www.enlightenment.org/contrib/devs/coding-conventions.md) will need to be rewritten before it can be merged into the code base.

## Git Best Practices ##

The Enlightenment Project uses the *git* version control system to manage its code base. The [Git Best Practices guide](https://www.enlightenment.org/contrib/devs/git-guide.md) offers advice on using the code base through git, including requirements for the format and style of all commit messages.

A web interface to the git repositories is also available at [git.enlightenment.org](https://git.enlightenment.org/) allowing for easy browsing and search.

## Phabricator Ticket System ##

If you're looking for an issue to solve, the [Phabricator Ticketing System](https://phab.enlightenment.org/) tracks all the outstanding tasks relating to the Enlightenment, Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), Elementary, and Terminology code bases.

## Patch Submission and Review ##

New contributors to the project are required to submit their patches through the Arcanist system, which automatically brings them through to the Phabricator Ticket System for tracking and review. The [Patch Submission and Review with Arcanist guide](https://www.enlightenment.org/contrib/devs/arcanist-guide.md) explains how to install, configure, and use Arcanist to submit patches for review.

## IRC Channels ##

The official Enlightenment IRC channels, hosted on the Freenode network, are often the quickest way to communicate with fellow developers. Available in English, German, French, and Korean, the channels are accessible 24/7 and are open to both developers and end-users.

Connection information is as follows:
