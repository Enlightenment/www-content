A horizontal rule goes below.

This is the first paragraph of the page. We should test a long one to
see how wrapping and other formatting works with it. **Bold Text**
works. //Italic Text// also works. __Underlined Text__ is fine as
well. ''Monospaced Text'' is there too. <del>Strike-through Text</del>
is also not a problem.

  - Ordered List Item
  - Item 2
  - Last item

  * Unordered List Item
  * Item 2
  * Third item
  * Last item

An external link like: [[http://example.com|External Link]] would go here.

And here is an inlined image, centered.

Sample code snippets and hilights

<code c>
  typedef struct blah Blah;
  int c;
  void function(char *blah) {
    double x;
    This_Type *y;
    Type_Here *z;
    int e = ENUM_HERE;
    x = 10;
    char *p = malloc(10);
    evas_object_del(p);
  }
</code>

<code lua>
  function hello(x)
    local y
  end
</code>

This should become a link to the [[start]] page. How about the [[blah]]
page too. Test autolink with evas_object_del() as a keyword.

Below between the hr's should be an externally included wiki page

----

{{page>blah}}

So how about Tables? well let's try one:

^ Header 1 ^ Header Column 2 ^ Column 3 header ^
| Cell 1   | Cell 2          | Cell 3          |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2          | Cell 3          |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2          | Cell 3          |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2          | Cell 3          |

And quotes:

Some text
> Quote this level
>> Another level
>>> Yet another level
