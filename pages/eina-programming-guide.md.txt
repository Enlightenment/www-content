# Eina Programming Guide #

Just a dummy page to contain and index the documents belonging to the Eina programming guide, to wit:

* [Iterator Functions](https://www.enlightenment.org/eina-programming-guide/iterator-functions.md)
* [Strings](https://www.enlightenment.org/eina-programming-guide/strings.md)


This can deleted when all the documents in the playground/eina-programming-guide/ namespace have been moved to their final resting place.
