==== Part Scaling ====

When scaling an Edje object, only the parts that are declared scalable in the
EDC file follow the scale request. This is done using the "scale" parameter.

As an example, the previous "rectangle2" part is set as scalable, so that it
is scaled when the Edje object is scaled.

<code c>
part
{
   name: "rectangle2";
   type: RECT;
   scale: 1;
   description
   {
      state: "green" 0.0;
   }
}
</code>

==== Using Image Set ====

When using images in the Edje EDC file, image file names must be listed in a
images block, so that Edje can use them in the theme. In this block, the
compression level and compression method of the image can also be defined.

Here is an example of an images block that lists two image files.

<code c>
images
{
   image: "image1.jpg" COMP;
   image: "image2.png" LOSSY 99;
}
</code>

As the devicescan have different screen sizes and resolutions, it is possible
to define that the used image set depends on the resolution.

In the example below the image named "image3" selects different files
depending on image size.

<code c>
images
{
   set
   {
      name: "image3";
      image
      {
         image: "image3_1.png" LOSSY 90;
         size: 0 0 50 50;
      }
      image
      {
         image: "image3_2.png" LOSSY 90;
         size: 51 51 200 200;
      }
      image
      {
         image: "image3_3.png" LOSSY 90;
         size: 201 201 500 500;
      }
   }
}
</code>

This is done with the "size" attribute that specifies the minimal width and
height and maximal width and height. If the width and height of the object are
below 50px, ''image3_1.png'' picture file is used. If they are bigger than
201px, ''image3_3.png'' file is used.

==== Resizing Borders ====

Sometimes it is needed to keep the borders of an image intact when resizing or
scaling it. The ''border'' attribute is here to do that.

<code c>
border [left] [right] [top] [bottom]
</code>

If set, the area (in pixels) of each side of the image is displayed as a fixed
size border, from the side -&gt; inwards. This prevents the corners from being
changed on a resize.

Here is a code example how to set a border of 10px on each side of the image.
This 10px border will not be resized when scaling the image.

<code c>
part
{
   name: "image_border";
   type: IMAGE;
   scale: 1;
   description
   {
      image
      {
         normal: "image1.jpg";
         border: 10 10 10 10;
      }
   }
}
</code>
