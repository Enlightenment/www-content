~~Title: A knob theme for the Elementary slider widget~~

==== Make an Elementary slider behave like a knob ====

Here is an example for an edje theme which makes an Elementary slider widget look and behave like a knob.

It will look like this {{:themes:edje-knob.png?nolink}} and works by displaying one of 60 images, depending on how much you drag the knob (up and down). Each of the images corresponds to a different rotation of the knob.

The edc file for this theme will be described below.
