~~Title: Getting Started on Themed and Edje~~

==== EDC File Basics ====

Let's start with a "Hello World" example. This is going to be in verbose mode to make it as easy as possible to break down before we start making it more compact. Start with a source "EDC" file like below:

<code edc example.edc>
collections {
  group {
    name: "example";
    parts {
      part {
        name: "background";
        type: RECT;
        description {
          state: "default" 0.0;
          color: 64 64 64 255;
        }
      }
      part {
        name: "label";
        type: TEXT;
        description {
          state: "default" 0.0;
          color: 255 255 255 255;
          text {
            font: "Sans";
            size: 10;
            text: "Hello World";
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>

Compiling it is easy. The compiled EDJ file is portable. It can be used on any OS and any architecture. It's basically a structured archive of all of the source material packed into a single file that is compressed and usable "as-is" at runtime without installation or unpacking.

<code bash>
edje_cc example.edc
</code>

Now a quick way to see your result is with the ''edje_player'' tool that will load a specific group in a file or just use the first it finds. In our case here we have only a single group so it should load just this group within the collections and let us see it:

<code bash>
edje_player example.edj
</code>

You now should see something like this in a window:

{{edje-hello.png?nolink}}

The window will be resizable, so resize it to see what happens when your group is resized too.
