====== Javascript Bindings for the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) ======

The EFL is a framework providing a great deal of functionality, from operating system abstraction to UI drawing abstractions and many others. The Javascript bindings for EFL are available in two flavors: A node.js module and direct embedding with libv8. Both are built on top of the libv8 JS engine.

Below follows a list of the EFL modules covered by the javascript bindings. For node.js users, all are available through the module **efl**.

<code javascript>
var efl = require('efl');
</code>

   * [[api/javascript/ecore|Ecore]] - Operating system abstraction and integration.
   * [[api/javascript/eet|Eet]] - Binary data parser and serializer.
   * [[api/javascript/eeze|Eeze]] - Hardware device manipulation and notification.
   * [[api/javascript/eio|Eio]] - Async input/output.
   * [[api/javascript/eina|Eina]] - Data types and basic abstractions.
   * [[api/javascript/eldbus|Eldbus]] - Dbus-integration.
   * [[api/javascript/ethumb|Ethumb]] - Generate thumbnail images of files.

===== Under the hood =====

The Javascript binding is split into two big parts. The first is a //manual// binding, wich is described in this documentation. The //automatic// binding covers the Eo-based classes, built with automatically-generated code and will be covered later.

Due to the C++ being the native language of the libv8, it's was also used to write the bindings, with the help of the C++ bindings for EFL.
