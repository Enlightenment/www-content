====== Javascript Bindings for the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) ======

The EFL is a framework providing a great deal of functionality, from operating system abstraction to UI drawing abstractions and many others. The Javascript bindings for EFL are available in two flavors: A node.js module and direct embedding with libv8. Both are built on top of the libv8 JS engine.

   * [[api/javascript/ecore|Ecore]] - operating system abstraction and integration.
   * [[api/javascript/eet|Eet]] - Binary data parser and serializer.
   * [[api/javascript/eet|Eeze]] - Hardware device manipulation and notification..
   * [[api/javascript/eina|Eina]] - data types and basic abstractions.
