    * Only one bug a report
    * Only report a bug in https://phab.enlightenment.org/maniphest/task/create/
    * Read what you wrote

=== Before reporting ===

//**__Can you reproduce the bug?__**//

Try to reproduce the bug with the latest version of the software, it could
already be fixed. If it is not the case, make sure the bug is reproducible,
make sure you have not changed a setting somewhere and know the way to get it.

//**__Has someone else already reported the issue?__**//

Check on https://phab.enlightenment.org/maniphest/query/all/ if your bug has
already been reported, if not you can report it.

//**__Where to report the bug?__**//

Only report a bug in https://phab.enlightenment.org/maniphest/task/create/.\\
Don't send bug reports and patches to the Enlightenment mailing list, bugs
will be lost. If there is more discussion needed add a bug report before or
after the discussion on the mailing list.

//**__Is it a visual bug?__**//

If reporting a visual bug, make absolutely sure you test with the default
theme. EFL developers do not support other themes, and bug related to other
themes must be sent directly to the theme's author.

//**__Are there a lot of traces of valgrind,gdb,etc for your bug?__**//

If there is a ton of output traces, please attach them as file uploads. And go
check in [[/debugging/apps_efl_debugging|Application EFL Debugging]] and
[[/debugging/enlightenment_debugging|Enlightenment Debugging]] sections to get
information.
