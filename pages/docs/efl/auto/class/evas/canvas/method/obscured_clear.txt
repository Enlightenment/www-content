===== Description =====

%%Remove all "obscured regions" from an Evas canvas.%%

%%This function removes all the rectangles from the obscured regions list of the canvas %%''e''%%. It takes obscured areas added with %%[[:docs:efl:auto:class:evas:canvas:method:obscured_rectangle_add|Evas.Canvas.obscured_rectangle_add]]%% and make them again a regions that have to be repainted on rendering updates.%%

<note>
%%This is a very low level function, which most of Evas' users wouldn't care about.%%
</note>

<note>
%%This function does not flag the canvas as having its state changed. If you want to re-render it afterwards expecting new contents, you have to add "damage" regions yourself (see %%[[:docs:efl:auto:class:evas:canvas:method:damage_rectangle_add|Evas.Canvas.damage_rectangle_add]]%%).%%
