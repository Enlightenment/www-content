===== Description =====

%%This gets the internal counter that counts the number of smart calculations.%%

%%Whenever evas performs smart object calculations on the whole canvas it increments a counter by 1. This is the smart object calculate counter that this function returns the value of. It starts at the value of 0 and will increase (and eventually wrap around to negative values and so on) by 1 every time objects are calculated. You can use this counter to ensure you don't re-do calculations withint the same calculation generation/run if the calculations maybe cause self-feeding effects.%%

//Since 1.1//
