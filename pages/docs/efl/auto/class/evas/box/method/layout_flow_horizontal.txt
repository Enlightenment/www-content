===== Description =====

%%Layout function which sets the box o to a flow horizontal box.%%

%%In a flow horizontal box, the box's child elements are placed in rows (think of text as an analogy). A row has as much elements as can fit into the box's width. The box's overall behavior is controlled by its properties, which are set by the evas_object_box_{h,v}_{align,padding}_set family of functions.  The size hints of the elements in the box -- set by the evas_object_size_hint_{align,padding,weight}_set functions -- also control the way this function works.%%

%%Box's properties: %%''padding_h''%% tells the box to draw empty spaces of that size, in pixels, between the child objects' cells. %%''align_h''%% dictates the horizontal alignment of the rows ($0.0 to left align them, $1.0 to right align). A value of $-1.0 to %%''align_h''%% lets the rows justified horizontally. %%''align_v''%% controls the vertical alignment of the entire set of rows ($0.0 to top, $1.0 to bottom). A value of $-1.0 to %%''align_v''%% makes the box to justify the rows vertically. The padding between them, in this case, is corrected so that the first row touches the top border and the last one touches the bottom border (even if they must overlap). %%''padding_v''%% has no influence on the layout.%%

%%Child element's properties: %%''padding_l''%% and %%''padding_r''%% sum up to the required width of the child element. The %%''align_x''%% property has no influence on the layout. The child's %%''padding_t''%% and %%''padding_b''%% sum up to the required height of the child element and is the only means (besides row justifying) of setting space between rows. Note, however, that %%''align_y''%% dictates positioning relative to the largest height required by a child object in the actual row.%%
