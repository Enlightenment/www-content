===== Description =====

%%Get the real Evas object created to implement the view of a given slideshow item.%%

%%This returns the actual Evas object used to implement the specified slideshow item's view. This may be %%''null''%%, as it may not have been created or may have been deleted, at any time, by the slideshow. **Do not modify this object** (move, resize, show, hide, etc.), as the slideshow is controlling it. This function is for querying, emitting custom signals or hooking lower level callbacks for events on that object. Do not delete this object under any circumstances.%%
