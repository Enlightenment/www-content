===== Signature =====

<code>
@property Elm.Entry.textblock {
    get {
        return: Efl.Canvas.Object;
    }
}
</code>

===== C signature =====

<code c>
Efl_Canvas_Object *elm_obj_entry_textblock_get(const Eo *obj);
</code>

===== Description =====

%%Returns the actual textblock object of the entry.%%

%%This function exposes the internal textblock object that actually contains and draws the text. This should be used for low-level manipulations that are otherwise not possible.%%

%%Changing the textblock directly from here will not notify edje/elm to recalculate the textblock size automatically, so any modifications done to the textblock returned by this function should be followed by a call to @ref elm_entry_calc_force.%%

%%The return value is marked as const as an additional warning. One should not use the returned object with any of the generic evas functions (geometry_get/resize/move and etc), but only with the textblock functions; The former will either not work at all, or break the correct functionality.%%

%%IMPORTANT: Many functions may change (i.e delete and create a new one) the internal textblock object. Do NOT cache the returned object, and try not to mix calls on this object with regular elm_entry calls (which may change the internal textblock object). This applies to all cursors returned from textblock calls, and all the other derivative values.%%
