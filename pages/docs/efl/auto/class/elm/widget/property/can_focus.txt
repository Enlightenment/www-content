  * **can_focus** - %%%%''true''%% if the object can be focused, %%''false''%% if not.%%
===== Description =====

%%The ability for an Elementary object to be focused.%%

%%Unfocusable objects do nothing when programmatically focused, being the nearest focusable parent object the one really getting focus. Also, when they receive mouse input, they will get the event, but not take away the focus from where it was previously.%%

<note>
%%Objects which are meant to be interacted with by input events are created able to be focused, by default. All the others are not.%%
