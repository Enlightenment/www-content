===== Description =====

%%Activate a genlist mode on an item.%%

%%A genlist mode is a different way of selecting an item. Once a mode is activated on an item, any other selected item is immediately unselected. This feature provides an easy way of implementing a new kind of animation for selecting an item, without having to entirely rewrite the item style theme. However, the elm_genlist_selected_* API can't be used to get what item is activate for a mode.%%

%%The current item style will still be used, but applying a genlist mode to an item will select it using a different kind of animation.%%

%%The current active item for a mode can be found by @ref elm_genlist_decorated_item_get.%%

%%Only one mode can be active at any time, and for only one item. Genlist handles deactivating other items when one item is activated. A mode is defined in the genlist theme (edc), and more modes can easily be added. A mode style and the genlist item style are different things. They can be combined to provide a default style to the item, with some kind of animation for that item when the mode is activated.%%

%%When a mode is activated on an item, a new view for that item is created. The theme of this mode defines the animation that will be used to transit the item from the old view to the new view. This second (new) view will be active for that item while the mode is active on the item, and will be destroyed after the mode is totally deactivated from that item.%%
