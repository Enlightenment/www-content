===== Description =====

%%Eval sizing.%%

%%Manually forces a sizing re-evaluation. This is useful when the minimum size required by the edje theme of this layout has changed. The change on the minimum size required by the edje theme is not immediately reported to the elementary layout, so one needs to call this function in order to tell the widget (layout) that it needs to reevaluate its own size.%%

%%The minimum size of the theme is calculated based on minimum size of parts, the size of elements inside containers like box and table, etc. All of this can change due to state changes, and that's when this function should be called.%%

%%Also note that a standard signal of "size,eval" "elm" emitted from the edje object will cause this to happen too.%%
