===== Description =====

%%Triggers for relayout due to obstacles' state change.%%

%%The obstacles alone don't affect the layout, until this is called. Use this after doing changes (moving, positioning etc.) in the obstacles that you  would like to be considered in the layout.%%

%%For example: if you have just repositioned the obstacles to differrent coordinates relative to the textblock, you need to call this so it will consider this new state and will relayout the text.%%
