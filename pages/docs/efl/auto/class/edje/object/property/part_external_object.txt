===== Description =====

%%Get the object created by this external part.%%

%%Parts of type external creates the part object using information provided by external plugins. It's somehow like "swallow" (edje_object_part_swallow()), but it's all set automatically.%%

%%This function returns the part created by such external plugins and being currently managed by this Edje.%%

<note>
%%Almost all swallow rules apply: you should not move, resize, hide, show, set the color or clipper of such part. It's a bit more restrictive as one must  never delete this object!%%
