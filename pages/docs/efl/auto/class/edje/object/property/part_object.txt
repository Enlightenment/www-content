===== Keys =====

  * **part** - %%The Edje part's name%%
===== Description =====

%%Gets a handle to the Evas object implementing a given Edje part, in an Edje object.%%

%%This function gets a pointer of the Evas object corresponding to a given part in the obj object's group.%%

%%You should  never modify the state of the returned object (with @ref evas_object_move() or @ref evas_object_hide() for example), because it's meant to be managed by Edje, solely. You are safe to query information about its current state (with evas_object_visible_get() or @ref evas_object_color_get() for example), though.%%

%%If the type of Edje part is GROUP, SWALLOW or EXTERNAL, returned handle by this function will indicate nothing or transparent rectangle for events. Use $.part_swallow_get() in that case.%%
