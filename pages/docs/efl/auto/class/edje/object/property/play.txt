===== Values =====

  * **play** - %%The play state, %%''true''%% by default.%%
===== Description =====

%%Whether this object is playing or not.%%

%%This property indicates whether the object is running or not. If stopped (or paused), all transitions are disabled and programs stop running, until resumed.%%

%%If play is disabled, the object will remain the same, and its parts will not change state. Note that play can be disabled during a transition between states, effectively freezing the object in flight. When paused, no events will be processed or sent.%%

%%Setting to %%''true''%% resumes playing from the current state.%%
