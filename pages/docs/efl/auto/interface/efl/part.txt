  * **[[:docs:efl:auto:interface:efl:part|Efl.Part]] //(interface)//**

===== Description =====

%%Interface for objects supporting named parts.%%

%%An object implementing this interface will be able to provide access to some of its sub-objects by name. This gives access to parts as defined in a widget's theme.%%

%%Part proxy objects have a special lifetime that is limited to one and only one function call.%%

%%In other words, the caller does not hold a reference to this proxy object. It may be possible, in languages that allow it, to get an extra reference to this part object and extend its lifetime to more than a single function call.%%

%%In pseudo-code, this means only the following two use cases are supported:%%

%%obj.func(part(obj, "part"), args)%%

%%And:%%

%%part = ref(part(obj, "part")) func1(part, args) func2(part, args) func3(part, args) unref(part)%%
