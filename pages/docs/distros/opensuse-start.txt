Installing Enlightenment, is easy on openSUSE!

You can either select enlightenment from the installer (net install only) or install the enlightenment package from yast or zypper. 

For Leap 42.2 and Tumbleweed the latest stable version will be installed, for Leap 42.1 you may want to add the development repo as listed below but this may be unstable

<note warning>The code below enables a development repo this should be considered unstable.</note>

First get the repository on your system. The openSUSE version will be auto-detected by zypper:
<code bash>
#as root
zypper addrepo -f obs://X11:Enlightenment:Factory enlightenment
zypper refresh enlightenment
</code>

Now you can install the Enlightenment pattern (openSUSE meta-package):
<code bash>
zypper install -t pattern enlightenment
</code>

If you want to install EFL only:

<code bash>
zypper install efl
</code>
