==== Getting into Development ====

If you are going to use EFL, we encourage you to actually work with
EFL from [[http://git.enlightenment.org|git]] mostly because it allows
you to either track stable branches to get latest fixes long before a
release is out, or to track latest features and development
continually. This is also the case if you want to contribute. Of
course you can use stable packages for your distribution as well.

==== API Documentation ====

Our documentation is a bit scarce at the moment, but that is something
we intend to solve. We will collect all documentation here and work on
improving our API references a lot.
