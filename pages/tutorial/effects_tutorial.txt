~~Title: Animation and Effect Types~~
==== Animation and Effect Types: Using Various Effect and Effect Types ====

The animation and effect tutorials demonstrate how to create and implement a
variety of animation effects with EFL and Elementary.

----
==== Ecore Animator: Creating Ecore Animations ====

This tutorial demonstrates how you can use Ecore animators to simplify the
creation of animations. Using Ecore animators, you can manually create your
own animations by changing and manipulating Evas object attributes. Ecore
animators work like timers, running callback functions over a given duration
(an animation timeline).

==== Edje Animation: Using the Edje Library to Create Animations ====

One of the greatest strengths of EFL and Edje is the ability to create
animations. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the Edje library to create
your own animations.

==== Elementary Animations: Applying Transition Effects to an Evas Object ====

This tutorial demonstrates how you can use Elm Transit to create animated
transitions effects, such as rotation, wiping, zooming, resizing, and fading,
to an ''Evas_Object''.
