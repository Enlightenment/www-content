~~Title: Javascript Tutorial~~
==== Javascript Tutorial [DRAFT]====

These Javascript tutorials describe the basics to compiles and run a Javascript example using Elementary in Node.Js

=== Prerequisite ===

Before you start you will want basic about how compile a EFL library

    * Installed from source: [[docs/efl/start|Get started with EFL]].

=== Dependencies ===

You will need additional dependencies to Javascript Bindings:

    * [[https://nodejs.org|node]] (4.2 or better)

=== Compilation ===

== Efl ==
To configure efl sources with bindings to use in nodejs add ''//––with-js=nodejs//'' in configure flags to generate node files

<code bash>
./configure --with-js=nodejs #in efl source path
</code>

and compile normaly

<code bash>
make
make install
</code>

== Elementary ==

In Elementary all you need is run ''./autotools'' and compile/install

<code bash>
./autotools #in elementary source path
make
make install
</code>

=== Node.Js ===

After all compiled and installed is time to use the modules in node.js. 

The default node.js files installed by efl/elm stay in prefix /lib path (if you don't define a prefix path is ''/usr/local/lib'')

Node.js need know where find efl/elm node modules, to that export NODE_PATH with the file path to modules.

<code bash>
export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib #if necessary replace with your prefix path
</code>

Now you are ready to use the modules in node.js, use ''require'' to import modules

<code javascript>
~$ node
> efl = require("efl")
> elm = require("elm")
</code>
